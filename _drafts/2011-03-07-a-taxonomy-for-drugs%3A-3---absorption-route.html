The controlled delivery and absorption of a drug is an incredibly important part of it's overall pharmaceutical properties, and is a potent driver of commercial/clinical adoption. There are clear trends in the physicochemical properties of drugs that are associated with various classes of absorption - for example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipinski_Rule_of_Five">Lipinski Rule of Five&nbsp;</a>is a heuristic associated with simple descriptors and likelihood of oral absorption. Also, to a very good first approximation, protein therapeutics are not absorbed when taken as an oral tablet. There is an important distinction between <b>Drug_Absorption_Class</b> and <b>Drug_Administration_Class</b>, this post relates to<b> Absorption.</b><br />
<br />
The body has an 'inside' and an 'outside', with a physical barrier of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial_cell">epithelial cells</a> forming the boundary between the two. There are different types of epithelial cell, for example those on the surface of the external skin are different to those inside the mouth, anus, vagina, bowel, <i>etc</i>. In order to enter the body a drug must cross this barrier, either through being delivered externally and being absorbed into the circulation (as in swallowing a tablet, and it being absorbed through the bowel wall, or rubbing a cream containing the drug onto the skin) or being physically delivered through the skin (as in an injection into the bloodstream).<br />
<br />
For the case where a drug is absorbed through the epithelium there are two clear cases - the first where the drug is primarily absorbed <i>via</i> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract">gastrointestinal tract</a> (gi tract) and secondly where it isn't. The GI tract has evolved to allow absorption and processing of nutrients within food stuff, so there are powerful hydrolytic processes applied to 'food' in order to break it down (primarily by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a>) into easily absorbed and safe components. There are two basic mechanisms through which this hydrolysis of stomach contents occurs - firstly <i>via</i> the low pH environment of the stomach, and then <i>via</i> various secreted digestive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinase">proteinases</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribonuclease">ribonucleases</a>. So in order to be absorbed <i>via</i> the gi tract a drug needs to be stable to the action of both acid hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation of the stomach (there are several physical schemes used to deliver drugs in oral form that avoid the acid in the stomach, but then allow absorption through the bowel walls. The drug then needs to pass through the epithelium to be further distributed by the circulatory system. Many small molecules are acid sensitive, or are insoluble under the conditions in the gut, and so are incompatible with oral delivery and gi tract absorption. When absorbed <i>via</i> the gut, drugs then pass directly to the liver, and face metabolism by a large family of oxidative enzymes. The structure of many molecules is too sensitive to handle this processing. ... and so many drugs are delivered topically, either to locally to the site of drug action, or to avoid the rapid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_metabolism">first pass metabolism</a> in the liver.<br />
<br />
In common parlance, an "Oral Drug" is equivalent to "oral delivery, gi tract absorption" but this is not always the case (notable exceptions include sublingual absorption, where a drug is absorbed through the skin under the tongue. An important recent drug that is orally dose, sublingually absorbed is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asenapine">Asenapine</a>.<br />
<br />
So for our developing drug taxonomy, <b>Drug_Absorption_Class</b>&nbsp;can be one of the following classes<br />
<br />
<b>Injected</b>&nbsp;- A drug that is delivered&nbsp;<i>via</i>&nbsp;physical penetration of the epithelium.<br />
<b>Enteral</b>&nbsp;- An orally dosed drug that undergoes the majority of its absorption <i>via</i>&nbsp;the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.<br />
<b>Topical</b> - A drug that is absorbed through the external surface of the body and not primarily&nbsp;<i>via</i> the gastrointestinal tract.<br />
<b>Other</b> - an absorption route not covered by the classes above.
