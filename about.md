Stories and news from [Computational Chemical Biology Group](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/john-p-overington) at [EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/). We work on computational aspects of drug discovery, and produce the **ChEMBL** family of data resources:

*   [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl) - for drug discovery bioactivity data.
*   [SureChEMBL](http://www.surechembl.org/) - for chemical structures from patents.
*   [UniChem](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/unichem) - for chemical structure integration across a large number of public resources.
*   The [SARfari](http://chembl.blogspot.com/2009/02/sarfari-overview.html)s - for systems-level views of kinases, GPCRS, and ADME biology.
*   [ChEMBL-malaria](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/malaria) and [ChEMBL-NTD](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chemblntd) - for neglected disease data.
*   [DrugEBIlity](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/drugebility) - for drug target prioritisation.
