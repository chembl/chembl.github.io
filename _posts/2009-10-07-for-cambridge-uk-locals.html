<P>
DUE TO INDUSTRIAL ACTION THE TALK BY CHRIS HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED TO 3PM ON FRIDAY 16TH OCTOBER - IN ROOM M/203.
<P>
<strike>On Monday 19th October, in the morning</strike>, we have a visit from Chris Lipinski, of the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipinski%27s_Rule_of_Five">'Rule of Five'</A> fame. The talk will be advertised on campus, but guests are welcome as well - it's just that I will need to tell security the names and affiliation of any visitors by Friday 16th October.
<P>
On this occasion the talk is titled <B>"The good, the bad and the unknown in drug discovery: a very opinionated discussion"</B>.
<P>
If you are interested in coming, <A HREF="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBLog] Chris Lipinski talk">mail me</a>.
<P>
Of course the photo above is not of Chris, but he does look strangely familiar ;)
