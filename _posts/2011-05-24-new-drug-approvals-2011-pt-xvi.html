<b>ATC code (partial): </b>J</div>
<br />
On May 23<sup>rd</sup>, the FDA approved Telaprevir (Tradename: <a href="http://www.trademarkia.com/incivek-85259126.html">Incivek</a>; Research Code: VX-950, NDA 201917), a <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A3EZI9">Hepatitis C virus NS3 protease</a>&nbsp;(HCV NS3) inhibitor, for the treatment of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C">chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1</a>&nbsp;infection, in combination with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peginterferon_alfa-2b">peginterferon alfa</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin">ribavirin</a>.  <br />
<br />
HCV is a prolonged infection that affects the liver and is caused by a small positive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus#Single-stranded_RNA_viruses_and_RNA_Sense">single-stranded RNA virus</a>, which is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact. Chronic hepatitis C is normally asymptomatic, but may lead to liver fibrosis, and if untreated, potentially fatal liver failure. There is currently no vaccine for this type of hepatitis.<br />
<br />
Telaprevir is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 3 (NS3) protease (ChEMBLID:<a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/index.php/target/inspect/CHEMBL4893">CHEMBL4893</a>; Uniprot ID:<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A3EZI9">A3EZI9</a>), a viral protein required for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (UniProt:<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P27958">P27958</a>) into mature forms of the NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B proteins (NS3 is Uniprot: <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/blast/?about=P27958[1027-1657]">P27958[1027-1657]</a>). These proteins are involved in the formation of the virus replication complex, and therefore are vital to its proliferation. In a biochemical assay, Telaprevir inhibited the proteolytic activity of the recombinant HCV NS3 protease domain with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 10 nM. <br />
<br />
HCV NS3 is a serine protease (Pfam:<a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family/Peptidase_S29">PF02907</a>). There are many protein structures known for this protein in complex with inhibitors, a typical entry is <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe-srv/view/entry/3rc4/summary">PDBe:3rc4</a>, as expected from early genome annotation, the NS3 proteinase has a fold distantly related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine_protease#Chymotrypsin-clan">chymotrypsin-like family of serine proteinases</a>, and contains the classic Asp-His-Ser <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_triad">catalytic triad</a>.<br />

<br />
<br />
The -vir USAN/INN stem covers antiviral agents, and the substem -previr indicates it is a serine protease inhibitor. Telaprevir is the second approved agent to target HCV NS3, following the approval earlier this month of Merck's <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/2011/05/new-drug-approvals-2011-pt-xiv.html">Boceprevir</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). Other compounds in this class in late stage clinical development/registration include Tibotec's TMC-435, and Bristol Myers Squibb's Asunaprevir (BMS-650032). Others at earlier stages of development include ABT-450, BI-201335, IDX-320, MK-5172, Vaniprevir (MK-7009), Narlaprevir (SCH-900518), Danoprevir (RG-7227, ITMN-191), BIT-225, VX-500, ACH-1625, GS-9256. <br />

Telaprevir (IUPAC: (1S,3aR,6aS)-2-[(2S)-2-({(2S)-2-cyclohexyl-2-[(pyrazin-2-ylcarbonyl)amino]acetyl}amino)-3,3-dimethylbutanoyl]-N-[(3S)-1-(cyclopropylamino)-1,2-dioxohexan-3-yl]-3,3a,4,5,6,6a-hexahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyrrole-1-carboxamide; SMILES: CCCC(C(=O)C(=O)NC1CC1)NC(=O)C2C3CCCC3CN2C(=O)C(C(C)(C)C)NC(=O)C(C4CCCCC4)NC(=O)C5=NC=CN=C5; PubChem:<a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=3010818&amp;loc=ec_rcs">3010818</a>; ChEMBL ID: <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/index.php/compound/inspect/CHEMBL231813">CHEMBL231813</a>) has a molecular weight of 679.8 Da, contains 4 hydrogen bond donors, 8 hydrogen bond acceptors, and has an ALogP of 2.69. The inhibitor is clearly peptide like, containing four amino acid residues, mimicking the natural substrate of the protease, and including a 'warhead' - the alpha-keto amide, which covalently binds to the catalytic serine residue of the target enzyme.<br />
<br />
Telaprevir is available as oral film-coated tablets of 375 mg. It has an apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of approximately 252 L, and, in patients who received a dose of 750 mg three times a day (the recommended daily dose is therefore a large 2.25 g (equivalent to 3,310 umol)), the exposure is characterised by an AUC of 22,300 ng.hr/mL, with a Cmax of 3510 ng/mL. Telaprevir should be administered with a standard fatty meal, since its bioavailability is enhanced by 237%. <i>In vitro</i>, protein plasma binding ranges from 59% to 76%.   <br />
<br />
The predominant metabolites of Telaprevir in plasma are the R-diastereoisomer (VRT-127394), which is approximately 30-fold less potent than the parent drug, pyrazinoic acid, and a metabolite that underwent reduction of the Î±-ketoamide bond of Telaprevir (which is, as expected not active against the target). Telaprevir is also metabolised by CYP3A4, being simultaneously a substrate and an inhibitor, and therefore, other therapeutic agents metabolised by CYP3A4 may prolong their therapeutic effect or adverse reactions. See prescribing information for the extensive list of drug-drug interactions and contraindications. <br />
<br />
Following administration of a single oral dose of 750 mg, Telaprevir is eliminated with a mean plasma half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of approximately 4.0 to 4.7 hours, and it has a mean total body clearance (CL/F) of approximately 32.4 L/hr. <br />
<br />
Telaprevir was developed almost in parallel with <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/2011/05/new-drug-approvals-2011-pt-xiv.html">Boceprevir</a>, the first-in-class inhibitor of the HCV NS3 protease. Both drugs require a high daily dose for an effective response, and are generally similar with respect to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic parameters.<br />
