We are thinking of holding an annotatathon for clinical development stage compounds next July, here on campus at the EBI in Hinxton. At this event we will assign/curate efficacy targets for all the clinical stage compounds we have by then identified, simplifying the work by pre-clustering by chemical class/therapeutic area. Data generated during the event will be placed online immediately, and would of course be fully Open (none of this frustrating, online access only for us!).<br />
<br />
If there is interest in taking part, and contributing to this effort, <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=Annotatathon">let me know</a>! Depending on the level of interest, I may apply for funding to help with travel/accommodation. If you are interested in funding this we'd be delighted to help with this
