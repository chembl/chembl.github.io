This week, our ChEMBL NAR Database paper made the milestone of over a hundred citations (in less than a year too). This made us all very, very happy, and for a few moments, we rested our fingers from our keyboards, and used our them instead to grasp a mug of coffee/tea; but only for a few seconds, before we got back to mixing and baking and cooking ChEMBL 15 for you all.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;hl=en&amp;cites=11246883844136979335">Here's a list </a>to the current citations of <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/D1/D1100.short">Gaulton et al., NAR Database, <b>40</b>, D1100-D1107, 2012</a>. Remember this is an Open Access paper.<br />

Please keep, keeping us happy by using our work, it's probably the biggest satisfaction we can get :)
