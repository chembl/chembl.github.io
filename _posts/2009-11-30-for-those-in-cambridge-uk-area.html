</div>We have Jean-Louis Reymond visiting us on the morning of Friday the 4th of December, he is going to give a seminar on his group's GDB databases (see previous blog posts, I think this is a very exciting area of science at the moment). If you are interested in coming, please <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBLog]%20I%20would%20like%20to%20come%20and%20hear%20Prof.%20Reymond%20talk">mail me</a> for details and to arrange access to campus.<br />
