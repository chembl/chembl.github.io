This is a very exciting project and will build an unprecedented collaborative database of rat toxicology data for a large number of clinical development candidates. It is also a chance to work in close collaboration with a network of some of the leading European academics, SMEs and pharmaceutical companies.<br />
<p>We have two posts available under this funding. The <a href="http://www.embl.de/aboutus/jobs/jobs_embl_ebi_hinxton/2010/w_10_011_ebi/index.html">first</a> is for a scientist with experience of datamining and analysis of data, preferably with good experience of bioinformatics or chemoinformatics. The <a href="http://www.embl.de/aboutus/jobs/jobs_embl_ebi_hinxton/2010/w_10_012_ebi/index.html">second</a> post is for an informatician to build a data repository, and then populate this with deposited curated toxicology data.<br />
<p>If you have any questions about the jobs, please feel free to <a HREF="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBLog] I have a question about the eTox jobs">mail us</A>.<br />
<p>The deadline for applications is 14th March 2010.
