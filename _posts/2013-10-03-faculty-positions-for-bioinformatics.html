<span style="font-family: inherit;">The Francis Crick Institute will open at St Pancras in central London in 2015. Its research will use interdisciplinary approaches to investigate the biology of human health and disease, supported by core funding from CRUK, the MRC, and the Wellcome Trust, and by grants from UK and international funding agencies.<br /><br />The Crick is expanding Computational Biology research as a key component of its scientific strategy. The institute will offer an outstanding environment for computational research, with excellent opportunities for wet/dry collaborations across the range of biomedical and clinical research disciplines, supported by a strategic alliance with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The new Crick laboratories will feature excellent computational facilities including a state-of-the-art data centre.<br /><b></b><br /><b><u>The London Research Institute</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.london-research-institute.org.uk/">http://www.london-research-institute.org.uk</a></b></span></div>
