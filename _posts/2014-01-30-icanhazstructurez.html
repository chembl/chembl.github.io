I needed a pdf for a presentation I was giving this morning, I was in a hotel, which doesn't have an institutional subscription, so was stuck. On twitter, there is a hashtag <b>#ICanHazPDF</b>, which is quite successful, but to be clear I didn't use that route ;{o .<br />
<br />
It got me thinking though, given the reach and immediacy of twitter, could I use it to get chemical structures - so <b>#ICanHazStructurez</b> was born. It worked, well in fact, and was very quick (see the image above - remember this was 6 am in the morning (in Germany at least).<br />
<br />
So a big high five to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Lewis_Lab">@Lewis_Lab</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nickholway">@nickholway</a>&nbsp;- FF and all that!
