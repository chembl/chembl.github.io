</div><p>Another good one-day conference next year is the Molecular Graphics and Modelling Society (<a href="http://www.mgms.org/">MGMS</a>) meeting <a href="http://www.mgms.org/CEA2DD_2010/index.htm">'Cutting Edge Approaches to Drug Design - 2010'</a> which is held at <a href="http://www.soas.ac.uk">SOAS</a> on Friday the 12th of March 2010. SOAS is right in the center of London, near to Russell Square tube station, there is loads of cool stuff to do nearby (as well as the talks, of course).
