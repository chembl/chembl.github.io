I'm chairing a session at the ACS Spring meeting in New Orleans, in early April 2013 (the 7th thru 11th are the dates of the ACS meeting itself, but I'll probably be finished by the 9th) and am making a visit to Miami and Kentucky on the same trip. I can probably squeeze in two more lab visits if there is interest in a ChEMBL seminar (I would need to leave the US at the latest on Tuesday 16th April). I'll need to look into the practicalities of travel, and realistically they'll need to be in the South-East, but I'm pretty hardy in the air - I don't mind odd timed flights.<br />
<br />
So if there is any interest, <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBL-og]%20Seminar%20in%20April%202013">let me know</a>.
