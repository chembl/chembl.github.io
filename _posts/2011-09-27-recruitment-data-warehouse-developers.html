We have recently completed the legal formalities for an exciting collaborative grant involving the development of a service infrastructure for data from EU-funded research into non-animal tests for predicting chemical safety. - the grant is called DiXa. We are currently recruiting two positions for this grant (and there will be some additional posts later). These will be in the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/">group of Ugis Sarkans</a> at the EBI.<br />
<br />
Further details on the positions can be found here.<br />
