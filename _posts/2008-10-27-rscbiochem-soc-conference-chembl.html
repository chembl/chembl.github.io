I have been invited to present at a joint Biochem Soc/Royal Society of Chemistry meeting in London, on Integration of Drug Discovery and Systems Biology' at Burlington House on the 28th November. I will try and present some new stuff there, if I get the chance to put together some nice slides - hopefully the assay clustering stuff is lying around somewhere. But again it looks an excellent meeting, worth attending for the other talks. <A HREF="http://www.biochemistry.org/meetings/programme.cfm?Meeting_No=WS00">Link to conference website</A>
