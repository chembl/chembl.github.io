So, the course is over for another year. It was really good fun to do, and thanks to all the attendees who made it really rewarding for us all. There is plenty for us to think about in what you asked, and we'll try and include a few more things in the ChEMBL interface. An especial thanks goes out to our visiting lecturers - John Irwin, Noel O'Boyle, Markus Sitzmann, Val Gillet, Andreas Bender, Darren Green, Bissan Al-Lazikani and Mike Barnes.<br />

The picture is of (most of) the course attendees and the faculty on the last day, it was raining, much like every day that week, so an indoor photo. It looks cool.<br />

Till next year!!
