</div>As part of a long-term project connected with literature and web mining, competitor intelligence, and the history of drug development; here is a spreadsheet of research code stems, company name, country of company, and the name of the company when the research code stem was in use. It is incomplete, but still quite substantial with over 600 stems documented.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to download and use <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1306676/Research%20Codes%202010-08-14.xls">the spreadsheet</a> in which ever way you please. If you find any errors, or can provide a longer list (as long as this is from Publicly available sources!) that would be fantastic. Any additions will be credited appropriately.<br />
<br />
So, Google docs is not currently working for me, but getting the list onto the blog itself, and therefore getting it indexed up in search engines, <i>etc</i>. was not too painful, so here <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/p/research-code-stems.html">is a link</a> to an HTML table (sorted by company name).
