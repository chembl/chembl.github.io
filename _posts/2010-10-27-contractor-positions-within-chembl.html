</div>As mentioned in a <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/2010/09/opportunities-to-work-with-chembl-team.html">previous post</a>, we now have some immediately available positions within our team for some short-term contractors (6 months to 1 year). These are for two collaborative (and very exciting) industry projects, and require good bioinformatics knowledge, programming in perl (or equivalent) knowledge of SQL, and database querying and integration. Previous experience in either target assessment, or computational studies of ADMET processes would be greatly beneficial (see below).<br />
<br />
One position will be to work on 'druggability' calculations, the second will be connected with comparative genomics of ADMET systems - building a prototype ADMET SARfari (see the SARfari tags on the ChEMBL-og for more details on SARfari). Positions are full time and require a pre-existing right of residence and also pre-existing right to work within the United Kingdom. Pay and general conditions are subject to negotiation. Work will be based at our Hinxton campus site. More details are <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBL-og]%20I%20am%20interested%20in%20more%20details%20on%20the%20contractor%20positions">available on request</a>.<br />
<br />
We will post additional information on LinkedIn in a day or so.....
