I came across this interesting paper from earlier this year - "<a href="http://www.fasebj.org/content/early/2011/01/24/fj.10-178947.abstract?related-urls=yes&amp;legid=fasebj;fj.10-178947v1">HIV proteinase inhibitors target the Ddi1-like protein of Leishmania parasites</a>", published in <a href="http://www.fasebj.org/">FASEB J</a>. HIV protease inhibitors were known to decrease levels of Leishmania <i>in vivo</i>, but the molecular target was not known. This paper shows that HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors are probably functional inhibitors of Ddi1 from <i>Leishmania spp.</i>&nbsp;Nelfinavir (the structure above) is a 440 nM IC<sub>50</sub> inhibitor of <i>L. major</i> Ddi1 (and weaker against the human ortholog 3.3 uM). This is on the face of it, a lovely example of drug repositioning - the use of a drug for a new, and in this case, a non-obvious use.<br />
<br />
HIV-1 PR (UniProt:<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9YQ34">Q9YQ34</a>) and Ddi1 (UniProt:<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A4H334">A4H334</a>) are both aspartyl proteinases (Pfam:<a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/clan/Peptidase_AA">CL0129</a>), share a common mechanism, and overall architecture (although HIV-PR is a homodimer, and Ddi1 is a single chain containing two 'copies' of the HIV-PR sequence). There is a human Ddi1 ortholog as well (UniProt:<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8WTU0">Q8WTU0</a>), and poking around in UniProt shows there is a <i>Tryp</i> orthologue as well, but not an obvious <i>Plasmo</i> one - but I haven't really looked too hard, so far.<br />
<br />
It is interesting to speculate what would be the most efficacious/potent launched/clinical stage HIV-1 PR inhibitor for the treatment of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis">Leishmaniasis</a> - and probably homology modelling and docking could allow a pretty good guess at this.
