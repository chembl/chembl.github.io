There is a great paper in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/17406773">Drug Discovery Today: Therapeutic Strategies</a> reviewing experience in a large number of drug repurposing experiments performed at one institute - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico">University of New Mexico</a>. There is a lot of interest in the potential of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_repurposing">drug repurposing</a>, many papers discussing various theoretical approaches, discussion of IP, <i>etc</i>, but relatively few present real-world, worked examples. The well-known examples tend to be the successful ones, and have now become almost cliches - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil">Sildenafil</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide">Thalidomide</a> for example. Discussion of the challenges encountered is far less common, and this paper covers a portfolio of projects, identified by a mix of empirical broad screening, virtual screening, or hypothesis-led research - a summary of each of them w.r.t. their status and progress is then outlined - finally some conclusions are presented - the most valuable and sobering ones being the limiting factors.<br />
<br />
A further feature of the paper is the sheer complexity (and cost) of this sort of work if tackled seriously with a genuine translational science approach, as opposed to a list of hits from an<i> in vitro</i>/virtual screen, that are proposed for testing.<br />
<br />
For those of you dying to know the 'punchlines' on the current challenges (as one might expect, data availability is a major component behind all of these), these are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Dosing and safety</li>
<li>Lack of integration with pharmaceutical sciences and toxicology</li>
<li>Appropriate intellectual property coverage</li>
</ul>
