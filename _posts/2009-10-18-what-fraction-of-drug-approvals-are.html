Continuing some earlier posts, here is a brief update. Below is a graph of NME approvals (US FDA) for the period 2003-2009. As is plain, there is no clear upwards trend for biologicals over this time period, and looking at INN approved names, it looks as if small molecules will be around as the major drug class for some time to come. 'Small molecules' are in various shades of blue, while 'biologicals' are in various shades of <strike>blue</strike>pink.
