<br />
We are exploring establishing links from the ChEMBL compounds to patents. The implementation can have two basic routes....<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Links from the interface to patents (simple and quick to do now we have UniChem).</li>
<li>Patent uri's in the database itself (more complex, and more difficult to keep up to date, but arguably more useful).</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
So to help our planning for next year, comments, wishes are most welcome....
