We had a support email recently that some things on the interface didn't work with chrome (an export function) - we couldn't repeat the issue with the equipment we have here at <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl">ChEMBL Towers</a>. But there are a lot of OS's and a lot of browsers out there, and we can't recreate every possible environment - interestingly, chrome is really popular amongst you people (the image above is a google analytics report of a weeks access of this very blog). I'm a safari man myself....<br />
<br />
So as a reminder, we love hearing about bugs and issues, we really do, so send them to chembl-help@ebi.ac.uk!
