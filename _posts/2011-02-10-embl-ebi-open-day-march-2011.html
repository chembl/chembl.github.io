Registration is now open for the next EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute Open Day, which will take place on Tuesday 15th March 2011. <br />
<br />
The 'Open Day' is the perfect opportunity for young scientists who are&nbsp;considering a career in bioinformatics (and related disciplines) to find out more about opportunities at Europe's main centre for bioinformatics. You will learn about&nbsp;cutting-edge research projects, get an overview of one of the world's most&nbsp;important collections of biological databases and tools, and be given time&nbsp;to talk one-to-one with the experts who develop and curate these services. There is also the chance to hear a talk from one of the ChEMBL team, talking about a curator job.<br />
<br />
Registration is FREE, but places are limited to 40 so please register now to&nbsp;avoid disappointment. Please go to <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/openday/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/openday/</a>&nbsp;for a full programme and registration details.
