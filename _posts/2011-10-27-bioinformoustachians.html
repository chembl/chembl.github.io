The <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EBI</a> has a team entered for the annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movember">Movember</a> fund raising event - this is focussed on raising money for 'male cancers' - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_cancer">testicular</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer">prostate</a>. The team is called&nbsp;<b>The Bioinformoustachians!, </b>so please consider sponsoring us over the coming month. Of course, as well as raising money for a serious cause, there will be some fun along the way as well. Watch over the next few days, as the full team signs up - we're gonna raise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadsamoney">Loadsamoney</a> (hopefully).<br />
<br />
For those unfamiliar with the idea - participants are clean shaved at the start and grow a moustache throughout the month gaining sponsorship for looking stylish/silly.<br />
