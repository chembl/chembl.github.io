Some of us are travelling to New York on business the week of 21st March 2011. We have some space in our schedule for portions of Tuesday the 22nd and Wednesday the 23rd, so if there is interest in meeting up for a coffee, a small seminar on ChEMBL, some training, <i>etc</i>., let me <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBL-og]%20I'm%20interested%20in%20meeting%20up%20in%20New%20York%20with%20ChEMBL!">know</a>. We'll probably stay somewhere on the upper East Side, but would be happy to travel to you to meet up.
