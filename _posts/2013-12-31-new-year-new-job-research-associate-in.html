As part of a collaboration the ChEMBL group are involved in with UCL, we are looking to appoint to a full time, three-year position in the Genetic Epidemiology Group, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, one of the component institutes of the UCL Faculty of Population Health Sciences.<br />
<br />
The appointee will join an exciting programme of work funded by the UCL National Institute of Heath Research Biomedical Research Centre, through its High Impact Award scheme.

The appointee will apply bioinformatic expertise to the late stage development of a new high density genotyping array designed to support drug target validation and related drug development issues; co-ordinate deployment of the array in a large consortium of highly-phenotyped cohort studies (the University College-London School of Hygiene-Edinburgh-Bristol consortium); undertake statistical analysis of the data; and play a leading role in writing manuscripts reporting findings arising from this work.<br />
<br />
The post is based at UCL, but the work will involve collaboration with colleagues in Edinburgh, Bristol, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the European Bioinformatics Institute at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire.<br />
<br />
<b>Key Requirements</b> - The post would suit someone whose background is in genetic epidemiology, statistical genetics, or bioinformatics, particularly those whose expertise extends across two or more of these areas. We expect the appointee to have a PhD or equivalent degree. We are willing to consider applications from exceptional individuals who have only recently obtained their PhD degree, provided they can demonstrate the requisite skill. We place a strong emphasis on potential for independence and on supporting career development.
