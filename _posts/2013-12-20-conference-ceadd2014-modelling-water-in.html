<span style="font-family: inherit;">A one day&nbsp;conference entitled '<b>Modelling Water in Biological Systems</b>' will be&nbsp;held at the <a href="http://www.soas.ac.uk/">School of Oriental and African Studies</a> (SOAS) in London on&nbsp;<b>Friday, 28 March, 2014</b>. This meeting, organised by the <a href="http://www.mgms.org/">MGMS</a>, is the&nbsp;latest in the 'Cutting Edge Approaches to Drug Design (CEADD)' series.<br /><br />In recent years, significant progress has been made in probing the role&nbsp;of water molecules in protein-ligand binding. &nbsp;Hydration is a crucial&nbsp;factor in understanding binding modes, ligand affinities and kinetics. &nbsp;Modelling tools are becoming available which may offer new insights in&nbsp;this exciting and evolving area of current research. This conference&nbsp;provides a timely overview of some of the main research avenues in this&nbsp;important field.</span>
