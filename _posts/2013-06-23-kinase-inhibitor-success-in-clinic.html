There is a lot of action in the approval of kinase inhibitors at the moment, and it is interesting to look at the attrition/survival of these through clinical trials, in the view above this is plotted as the number approved vs the number in the pipeline (the table takes care of mergers, compound acquisitions and so forth). The pale blue dotted line is the trend-line through the data, do not draw too much into this though...<br />
<br />
It's interesting to see that Pfizer and GSK are doing relatively well, and Lilly and Roche (inc. Genentech) are doing relatively badly - <i>across kinase inhibitors</i>. But it doesn't make many approvals to make a difference to this!<br />
<br />
Thanks to Krister Winnerberg for some cleanup of the kinase inhibitor dataset.<br />
<br />
For clarification:<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>this includes the indirect kinase inhibitors of the -rolimus class (7 approved, 1 of these Japan only).</li>
<li>the total number of kinase inhibitors in the clinic in the dataset is 392, with 29 approved</li>
<li>the Japan only inhibitor Fasudil is included in the set of approved small molecule inhibitors</li>
</ul>
