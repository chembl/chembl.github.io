Further to my post a few months ago (<a href="http://chembl.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/to-remove-or-not-to-remove-that-is.html" target="_blank">To Remove or Not to Remove</a>) about removing certain problem metal-containing&nbsp;compounds,&nbsp;we have now come up with a plan of what to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote type="cite">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Instead
 of labeling this curation as ‘removal of inorganics’, or ‘removal of 
organometallics’, we simply want this to be known as ‘removal of some 
metal-containing compounds’.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The criterion that we used was to 
exclude a large proportion of compounds that contained a metal, apart 
from cases where a metal was commonly found as part of a pharmaceutical 
preparation (e.g. Ranitidine Bismuth Citrate <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/compound/inspect/CHEMBL2111286" target="_blank">CHEMBL2111286</a>, Silver Sulfadiazine <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/compound/inspect/CHEMBL1382627" target="_blank">CHEMBL1382627</a>, Bacitracin Zinc <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/compound/inspect/CHEMBL2096639" target="_blank">CHEMBL2096639</a>). The 
reasoning behind the removal of such compounds was that most of these 
metals are bonded to&nbsp;the rest of the compound components via coordinate bonds. However, due 
to <a href="http://www.inchi-trust.org/fileadmin/user_upload/html/inchifaq/inchi-faq.html#7.3" target="_blank">InChI limitations</a>, there is no way of creating a Standard InChI that 
retains coordinate bond information. As we use Standard InChI as the 
main compound identifier of uniqueness in ChEMBL, it was decided to 
exclude the structures altogether.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
This change will come into effect with the release of ChEMBL_17, and only affects ~3,200 compounds. The compound image on the interface will be replaced with an icon that shows it’s a metal-containing compound (see picture, above). The structures will not be part of the download set on the FTP site, but we will retain the molecular formula in both the downloads and on the ChEMBL interface, so that you can still see the elemental make up of the compound. We will, of course, retain all of the bioactivity data on these compounds.</div>
