Sorry for not having posted for so long, but some good news. There will be a residential course held at the EMBL-EBI from <B>Monday 25th January to Friday 29th January 2010</B>, the agenda will focus on applications of SAR databases to biological problems, but of course we'll also include contributions from many other faculty at the EMBL-EBI to illustrate how 'it all fits togther'. We hope to have <B>eight full bursaries</B> available for the course, and registration will open at the end of this July. I'll post further details on the <A HREF="http://www.chemblog.org">chembl-og</A> when there is more available.....
