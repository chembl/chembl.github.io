The prevalence of SLE varies among differing ethnic groups, and countries, <i>e.g.</i> 40 per 100,000 in Northern Europe, 53 in 100,000 in the US, and 159 in 100,000 among people of Afro-Caribbean descent; this translates to about 159,000 cases in the US, among 1.5 million cases of different forms of lupus in general. In SLE, periods of illness alternate with remissions, and symptoms are diverse, comprising fever, malaise, joint pains, myalgias, and fatigue, but also  dermatological symptoms (<i>e.g.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malar_rash">malar rash</a>), anemia, cardiac, pulmonary and renal  impairments as well as neurological and neuropsychiatric syndromes such as headache and depression, rendering diagnosis challenging. SLE is currently incurable, and its symptomes are traditionally treated with powerful agents such as cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.<br />
<br />
Belimumab acts by binding to the soluble form of B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS, a.k.a. BAFF, TNFSF13B, CD257, Uniprot:<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9Y275">Q9Y275</a>&nbsp;Pfam:<a href="http://pfam.janelia.org/family/TNF">PF00229</a>), a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNF_family">TNF superfamily</a> of proteins. BLyS promotes the survival and development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_lymphocytes">B-lymphocytes</a> into mature plasma B cells; these key immune system cells produce antibodies, mediating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immune_system">humoral immune response</a>. BLyS was discovered for its immune stimulant properties in 1999 by Human Genome Sciences (<a href="http://www.hgsi.com/">HGS</a>), who jointly with GSK then developed Belimumab as an effective BLyS inhibitor, and ultimately the first new lupus drug since 1955.<br />
<br />
As the name Belimumab implies, it is a human (-u-) immunomodulatory (-lim-) antibody.<br />
<br />
The structure of the soluble form of BLyS is known, a typical pdb entry is <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe-srv/view/entry/1kxg/summary">1kxg</a>.<br />
