The Society for Medicines Research (<A HREF="http://www.smr.org.uk">SMR</A>) is a UK-based society for those interested in drug research, they hold a regular series of meetings themed around particular areas.
<P>
When I got home yesterday, in my letterbox,I found the flyer for their next meeting, which looks good, so I thought I would post details here, and potentially encourage people to either go, or maybe even join the SMR.
<P>
The next meeting focussing on site-specific delivery of particular therapeutic agents and principles of local drug delivery is on the 11th June and is at Horsham in West Sussex. The program and registration form can be found <A HREF="http://www.smr.org.uk/meetings/20090611/RegistrationForm.pdf">here</A>.
<P>
The picture above I <A HREF="http://3rings.designerpages.com/2008/02/22/no-10-letterbox/">found on the web</A>, It is of a 'letterbox' letterbox, sort of recursive, eh?
