It is impossible to underestimate the importance of drug discovery researcher community groups in the advance of drug discovery science in general, professional networking, and precompetitive and collaborative activities. A prime example is the <a href="http://www.ukqsar.org/ukqsar/">UK QSAR and Chemoinformatics Group</a>, who have been in existence since 1986. It is therefore a pleasure to host the Autumn 2010 meeting here at the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL-EBI</a>, on Tuesday 12th October 2010 (there will be an informal meal, the evening before at a local hostelry for those interested). Finally, you don't have to work in the UK to attend!<br />

Registration (which is free) is now open at&nbsp;this <a href="http://www.ukqsar.org/ukqsar//current/2010-10-12/main.html">link</a>.
