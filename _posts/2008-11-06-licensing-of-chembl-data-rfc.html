I have been thinking long and hard about the actual process for the public distribution of the ChEMBL data, and nothing is decided yet; however, I think it is likely that there will be a license for the distribution. In line with some of the existing 'free' EMBL-EBI resources, this is likely to take the form of one of the Creative Commons licenses (see <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">http://www.creativecommons.org</a> for more details. So as a question, what experience do people have with these licenses, as applied to public domain databases?<div>

<p>Oh, The license we are most like to use <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/">is..... </a> Basically this allows redistribution and the production of derivative works, while applying conditions that attribution must be provided, and that any derivative works will be similarly shared.</p></div>
