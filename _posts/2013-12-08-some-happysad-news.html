As regular followers of the <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/">ChEMBL-og</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/johnpoverington">twitter</a> will know, Ben Stauch had his <i>viva voce</i> and passed his thesis defence, and is now a fully fledged PhD graduate from the University of Cambridge. Ben hung around with us a little time after, working on a small fun project applying ChEMBL to compound/target selection. He is off fairly soon, so it's almost time to say goodbye and good luck to him. There's a few papers left from his predoc studies, so watch out for these as they appear.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
He's now looking for jobs, and so if you are looking for someone who knows ChEMBL inside out, with a good background in NMR/X-ray, docking and simulation, stats and programming, he would be great employee! His LinkedIn profile is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/benjamin-stauch/14/153/6b1">here</a>&nbsp;if you want to get in touch with him.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
'<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Six_(The_Prisoner)">I am not a number, I am a free man</a>', is not quite true for Ben, who is now actually a number - his ORCID is 0000-0001-7626-2021<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
It's also a pretty big milestone for me in my career - for over 20 years I worked in the commercial sector, so didn't supervise students, and Ben is the first I've helped get across the line. I really enjoy working with predocs - providing some coaching and support, encouraging independence, making introductions and assisting with networking, and most importantly in my view, trying to encourage a sense of wonder in discovery and knowing where the real challenges in the field are - avoiding the well-trod and over-explored paths. Our other students are also doing well - Felix has submitted, and Rita and Samuel are either writing up, or starting to write up. Oh, finally we have a new student, Jose, who will join us in January 2014.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Enough of this sentimental self-reflection! This post is here to provide a link&nbsp;to Ben's thesis - this will eventually appear on the EMBL library site, but it's&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxI6zHMffoGDNnNkeEQ5MlBVcEE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, now.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Good luck, thanks, and the very best of wishes the future Ben!</div>
