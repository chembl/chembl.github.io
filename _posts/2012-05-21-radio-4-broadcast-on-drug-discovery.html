Paul Workman of the <a href="http://www.icr.ac.uk/">Institute of Cancer Research</a> is due to feature in a BBC Radio 4 special exploring the future of drug discovery in the UK, which will be broadcast tomorrow Tuesday 22nd May. The 40-minute programme, called The End of Drug Discovery and presented by veteran science broadcaster Geoff Watts, starts at 8pm.<br />
<br />
The programme will “examine whether sources of better pharmaceutical treatments are drying up, in light of reports that suggest making new and improved drugs available to patients is becoming more difficult and increasingly expensive,” the BBC said. Professor Workman was recorded discussing the issues facing the pharmaceutical industry, and the role that non-profit and academic organisations like the ICR can play in driving drug discovery progress.<br />
<br />
The programme will be repeated on Sunday 27th May at 5pm and you can also listen to it live here:  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01hxh76">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01hxh76</a>
