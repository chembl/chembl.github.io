Just a little diversion, but a nice one at that. I am a fan of <A HREF="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</A> - it really is the only way to maintain an address book in these volatile times! Anyway, I recently got in touch with a colleague from the past, and clicked <A HREF="http://ultrawide.wordpress.com/">his blog</A>, listed on LinkedIn. <B>Oh My Goodness Me!</B> Very interesting and cool photos.
