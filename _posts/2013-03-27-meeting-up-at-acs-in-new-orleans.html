A couple of us are out in New Orleans for the ACS in a few weeks - if any ChEMBL users would like to meet up to get some training, ask questions, suggest improvements to what we do, or just grab a beer or coffee, we'd be very happy to do so. We arrive Sunday and leave Tuesday night.<br />

The picture is rather amusing, and looks a little like Mark and me, sort of. Credit for image is detailed in the image itself.....<br />
