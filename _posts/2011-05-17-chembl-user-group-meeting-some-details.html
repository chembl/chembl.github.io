</div>The agenda for the first ChEMBL user group meeting is below, we also have some additional speakers on various collaborative projects likely to be of interest to attendees, as extra-meeting items. Many thanks to the speakers and to Brad Sherbourne of Merck for putting this together.

<P>


The presentations will be a mix of slides and generous discussion time, giving plenty of opportunity to shape the future development of ChEMBL.
