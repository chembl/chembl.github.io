An interesting compound synonym error recently caught our eye. It is in the existence of a common corrupted synonym in the research code for Imatinib - the correct research code is STI571, but it is surprisingly commonly found as ST1571 where the capital I has been replaced by the number 1. In many fonts of course, these are identical, or very close, in rendering (as is the lower case l). You may think that it is a rare error, but I guess once made, it has widely propagated across the web. Of course ST1571 could be anything, a hammer, a breed of carrot, <i>etc</i>, but most of the references to ST1571 are in fact to Imatinib.<br />
<br />
As of 16th November, the google search counts are 84,600 for STI571, and 18,100 for ST1571. And now, damn, I've further propagated this confusion of the co-occurrence relationship with these words and Imatinib!<br />
<br />
So, this is mere bagatelle, a minor frippery, a rabbit-hole of nihilism? - but these things are important when you want to reliably aggregate and mine across free format Interweb text.....
