<LI>Room Quality - 3/10 OK room, noisy air-conditioning, a nice view from the window. The staff did not seem too happy, and were not that helpful, and service was slow.
<LI>Getting There - 7/10 About a 20 minute cab ride from the airport (ca. $30), but conveniently located. Close to the University (I guess the name is appropriate then), and also close to a good University beek store.
<LI>Cost - 5/10 - ca. $200 a night.
<LI>Phone reception - 7/10 - Good reliable signal, but it is a city center location....
<LI>Internet - 6/10 - Wireless in the rooms, but a convoluted security key mechanism. But there is a PC with a web browser in the room.
<LI>Conference facilities - n/a. Typical hotel meeting room setup - did not try them out. 
<LI>Mushroom factor - 1/10 - looks like a pretty bleak place nearby, but I didn't have the time to fully check.
