We regularly get request for internships in our group, and we are keen to host suitable scientists from a broad range of molecular informatics and IT backgrounds. These visits are typically for from two to three months in our lab here at the EMBL-EBI, and there is always lots of work to be done. We can provide modest financial support, but cannot cover travel costs to/from the UK.
<P>
If you wish to apply, please use this <A HREF="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBLog] Internship request">link</A> and 1) attach a current and accurate cv/resume, 2) state when you are available to work, and 3) (MOST IMPORTANT) what you would like to achieve during your time with us.
