</div>We are speaking at a training school on the prioritisation of drug targets for neglected diseases running from May 16th to May 21st 2011, held at the University of Siena, Italy. It is organised under Working Group 1 of COST Action CM0801. Here is some text from the course brochure (which can be found <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1306676/Announcement.ppt">here</a>)<br />
<br />
<blockquote>This training school was conceived to teach and train researchers on the currently available  tools that may lead to drug target identification and prioritization, before moving to their validation <i>in vivo</i>. The course will consist of lectures and practical classes. In guided hands-on computer sessions all participants will analyze sequence, structure, and function of unknown sequences. By that they will learn about the existence as well as the source and availability of bioinformatics software and how to apply these tools and interpret results with confidence. The school will provide computers to all trainees. All lectures will be in English.<br />
</blockquote><br />
Spaces are limited, and the deadline for applications is March 4th 2011.
