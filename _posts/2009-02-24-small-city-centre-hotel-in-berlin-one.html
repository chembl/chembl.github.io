A small city centre hotel in Berlin, one of my favorite cities. I arrived in the dark, and left in the dark, but it was great; quick checkin, helpful staff and a quiet room (no night-clubs, pubs, or street-fights outside). Truly restful. Near to the hotel is the excellent book/cd store Kulturkaufhaus Dussmann.

Overall a sunny score of 67%. An excellent city centre choice for a travelling scientist.

<LI>Room Quality - 8/10 Small, but perfectly formed, other than too small a distance between the desk, chair and the bed it could not be faulted. Quite a creative layout for such a tiny room. The bed was like lying on a magic, fluffy cloud though....
<LI>Getting There - 8/10 About a Euro35/25 minute cab ride from Shonefeld airport (the Berlin airport served by the budget airlines). I did not have time for museums, but Berlin is, I think, unmatched in quality museums and galleries, many would be within walking distance of the hotel. Don't you just hate 'interactive displays' at museums nowadays, give me a large display cabinet of stuffed, well curated and annotated histricomorphs everytime.....
<LI>Cost - 7/10 - Excellent value for money. Good balance of budget and comfort.
<LI>Phone reception - 8/10 - Good reliable signal, but it is a city center location....
<LI>Internet - 8/10 - Wireless in the rooms, worked perfectly. Fast, mail ports were all open.
<LI>Conference facilities - n/a. I don't think they have anything.
<LI>Mushroom factor - 1/10 - More chance of an ink-well than an ink-cap here!
