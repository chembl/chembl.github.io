We're pleased to announce the release, a few moments ago of ChEMBL_06. This contains an additional 29,142 compound records and 138,348 new bioactivities. We've also done quite a lot of compound cleanup, names, research codes (<i>vide infra</i>), and so forth. A variety of database dumps are available from the public ftp site, and the live web database is now connect to ChEMBL_06.<br />
<br />
Additional data this release includes the standard literature data, but also the data from the brilliant <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/translation/">Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer</a> project, coordinated by <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/faculty/umcdermott/">Ultan McDermott </a>at the Sanger Center (interested readers in the oncology area are also pointed to this <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/2010/07/from-one-of-our-collaborators-cansar.html">previous blog post</a>).
