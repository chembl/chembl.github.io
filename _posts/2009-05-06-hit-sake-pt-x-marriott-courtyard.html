I was here for a weekend meeting in Paris. The meeting was great, some really, really interesting people, and a nice crisp pace to discussions, agreements and actions. I hope I picked up a few hints! The hotel is in a suburb of Paris, but close enough to walk the L'arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysees, <I>etc</I>. The other great thing about the trip was just how good the Eurostar is now, especially that the St. Pancras terminal is fully functional. The only thing to watch out for are all the 'helpers' at Gare de Nord when you arrive - I didn't, but I will next time! Oh, and now the pound and Euro have parity, it is so, so expensive on the continent.

An overall score of 44%, let down by cost and internet.

<LI>Room Quality - 3/10 OK Room, but despite the fact that I had a non-smoking room, someone had been smoking in there.
<LI>Getting There - 5/10 About a Â£15 cab ride from Gare de Nord, nice quick roads and takes about 20 minutes.
<LI>Cost - 3/10 - <I>ca.</I> 450 Euro rate on the inside of the door. I cried. Hopefully the meeting got a good rate on the room. The breakfast and food were a delight though.
<LI>Phone reception - 6/10 - Good reliable signal, but it is a city center location....
<LI>Internet - 3/10 - 20 Euro for 24 hours, it worked for 3 hours, then blocked me. The helpline didn't help, and when it worked it was really slow.
<LI>Conference facilities - 7/10. Good, high quality facilities, projectors, wireless networking in the meeting rooms, well equipped.
<LI>Mushroom factor - 2/10 - A couple of polypores on the trees, but city centre (roll on Stromberg!)
