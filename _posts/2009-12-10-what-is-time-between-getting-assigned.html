</div>Here's an interesting graph (below) - it is of the gap between being assigned a USAN and being approved (in the US). The data covers the last ten years of US approved drugs, and then, only those for which I had a USAN date available (there are a total of 189 drugs covered in this current analysis). There is a big long tail, so some compounds get assigned their USANs about 30 to 40 years before approval (however, this is a very small fraction). Typically, a launched drug gets assigned its USAN about two to three years before approval. So one inference of this observation is that USANs of today are likely (<i>on average, and if they do indeed get approved</i>) in 2012-2013. Also, for USANs that are 8 years or older, there is little chance (<i>on average</i>) of them still becoming drugs.<br />
<p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SlPG9DIz_AA/SyFO_glQ0JI/AAAAAAAAAm0/N_FvbJ0FV9Q/s1600-h/Delta+USAN+date.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SlPG9DIz_AA/SyFO_glQ0JI/AAAAAAAAAm0/N_FvbJ0FV9Q/s400/Delta+USAN+date.png" /></a><br />
</div><p>It would be interesting to try and convert this into a probability estimate of a USAN becomming a drug, if it hasn't been approved yet. There would also appear to be some interesting patterns in the fraction of approved USANs. If I do any of this today, I'll post the results, otherwise, there is a stack of email for me to reply to.<br />
<P><I>UPDATE</I> So a little bit of toy maths and modelling would indicate that the probability of a compound with an approved USAN ever becoming approved as a drug is in the range 20-25%, and if a USAN has existed for ten years (or more) and not yet approved as a drug, the future likelihood of approval is <I>ca.</I> 2%. So, if we now take USANs that are ten or more years old and apply these <B>estimates</B> there are about 180-200 new 'old drugs' to be discovered/commercialised. Pretty interesting, eh?<br />
<p>The picture is how I would like to imagine my currently lost suitcase on its return to me. Reality will be somewhat different.
