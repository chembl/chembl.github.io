Liraglutide, previously known as NN2211, is a <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P43220">glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor</a> agonist indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2">type 2 diabetes mellitus</a>. People with this type of diabetes are often overweight, have high blood pressure and/or cholesterol and become insensitive to insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the commonest form of diabetes, and is a major health problem in 'developed' economies.  Liraglutide ATC code is <a href="http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=A10BX07">A10BX07</a>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Liraglutide works by activating the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), which in turn stimulates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase">adenylyl cyclase</a> pathway leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. GLP-1R is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretin_receptor_family">class-II GPCR</a> (also known as secretin receptor family). Liraglutide is the second GLP-1 agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, after Exenatide (marketed as Byetta), which reached the market in 2005. Other -glutides in development include Taspgolutide (R1583 or BIM-507) developed by Roche, and Abiglutide (a stabilized GLP-1 analogue fused to serum albumin) from GSK.    Liraglutide is an engineered form of the natural human GLP-1 peptide (one amino acid difference to the major circulating form of GLP-1, GLP-1(7-37) - an arginine replaces a lysine at position 34), an additional modification is the addition of palmitic acid attached <i>via</i> a glutamic acid spacer at position 26. The molecular weight of Liraglutide is 3751.2 Da.<br />
<br />
Each standard dose contains 1.8mg of Liraglutide (equivalent to 480 nmol). Dosing is as a once daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injection.    Liraglutide has a plasma half-life of ~13 hr (far longer than the <i>ca.</i> 2 min half life of the natural GLP-1 peptide). Slowing the fast degradation of GLP-1 is the basis of the therapeutic mechanism of the -gliptin class of DPP-IV inhibitors, <i>e.g.</i> Saxagliptin and Sitagliptin). The absolute bioavailability of Liraglutide, after s.c. dosing is 55%, and has high plasma protein binding &gt; 98%. The volume of distribution Vd is 0.07L/kg, with a clearance of 1.2 L/h.    Liraglutide has a boxed warning (risk of thyroid C-cell tumours).
