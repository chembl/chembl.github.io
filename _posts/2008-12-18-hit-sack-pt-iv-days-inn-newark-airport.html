Hey, it's lucky that I love the smell of kerosene in the morning. My travel plans had been disrupted by snow storms, so I had a bonus night with a bed (as opposed to a red-eye seat) at Newark Airport. There aren't many places you can watch a monorail directly from your bed - and probably even fewer where people on the monorail can watch you - this may not be to everyone's taste.

However, overall, on the scored features, a solid 47% score.

<BL>
<LI>Room Quality - 5/10 'Functional', you get the idea. 
<LI>Getting There - 5/10 A quick courtesy bus ride from P4 terminal on the monorail. However, I had to call the bus after being out in the cold.
<LI>Cost - 8/10 ca. $70 a night, can't be faulted, excellent service from staff.
<LI>Phone reception - 7/10 good solid four bars. 
<LI>Internet - 3/10 I found the wireless intermittent, and slow.
<LI>Conference facilities - n/a - Not part of their offering.
<LI>Mushroom factor - 0/10 not a hope of a fruiting body with ten miles of here, I fear.
