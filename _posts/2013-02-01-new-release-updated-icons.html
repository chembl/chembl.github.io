<div style="text-align: left;">
In the recent release of CHEMBL_15, we have revisited the information displayed in the drug icons used in the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb">ChEMBL interface</a> and in the <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/2012%20New%20Drugs">ChEMBL-og New Drug Approvals monographs</a> and we have made a few changes.<br />
<br />
The following images show the main changes (in this example, for the case of an oral synthetic small molecule):<br />

<br />
1. We have visually separated the <b>ingredient-specific information (icons in green)</b> from the <b>product-specific information (icons in blue)</b>.<br />
<br />
2. The <b>chirality icon</b> will now also show if the ingredient is dosed as a racemic mixture (an image of two human hands).<br />
<br />
3. An extra icon has been added to indicate the <b>marketing status</b> of a drug product. The product can be available as prescription (an image of the letters RX), over-the-counter (an image of the letters OTC) or discontinued (an image of the letters of RX with a stripe across it).<br />
<br />
In summary...<br />
<br />
The ingredient icons (in green) display the following information (from left to right)<br />
<dl>
<dt><b>Drug class</b></dt>
this can either be <dd>Synthetic small molecule </dd><dd>Natural product-derived small molecule </dd><dd>Inorganic small molecule </dd><dd>Peptide/protein </dd><dd>Monoclonal antibody </dd><dd>Enzyme </dd><dd>Oligonucleotide </dd><dd>Oligosaccharide.
</dd>
<dt><b>Rule of Five</b> </dt>
<dd>An image of the number five: this is either pass or fail - we fail a molecule if it fails to pass all the individual tests (usually people use fail one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipinski%27s_Rule_of_Five">parameter</a>); we use <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp980230o">AlogP</a> for the calculations and use 5.0 as a cutoff.</dd>
<dt><b>New target</b> </dt>
<dd>An image of a 'bullseye' target: this is either true or false - the target here refers to the molecular target responsible (or believed to be responsible) for its therapeutic efficacy.</dd>
<dt><b>Chirality</b> </dt>
<dd>An image of two human hands: the drug is dosed as a racemic mixture. </dd><dd>An image of a chiral human hand: the drug is dosed as a single optically active substance.</dd>
<dt><b>Prodrug</b> </dt>
<dd>An image of a par of scissors: the drug is essentially inactive in the dosed form and requires some chemical change in order to become pharmacologically active against its efficacy target.</dd><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</dl>
The product icons (in blue) display the following information<br />
<dl>
<dt><b>Oral delivery</b> </dt>
<dd>An image of a capsule.</dd>
<dt><b>Parenteral delivery</b> </dt>
<dd>An image of a syringe.</dd>
<dt><b>Topical delivery</b> </dt>
<dd>An image of an ointment tube.<br />
Some drugs are dosed in multiple forms, so this is why we haven't collapsed these down to a single state. Also this icon actually represents the absorption route (so some drug that are actually deliver orally, may in fact be sublingually absorbed).</dd>
<dt><b>Boxed warning</b> </dt>
<dd>An image of a black box: this is either true or false.</dd>
<dt><b>Availability</b> </dt>
<dd>An image of the letters RX: the product is available as prescription. </dd><dd>An image of the letters OTC: the product is available over-the-counter.</dd><dd>An image of the letters RX with a stripe across: the product is discontinued.</dd>
