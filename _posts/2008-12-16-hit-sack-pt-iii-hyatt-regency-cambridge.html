Well, I'm travelling a lot at the moment, and this particular place is like returning home - if your home is a stylish 70's themed hotel that is.

Overall a rib-rattling score of 58%.

<LI>Room Quality - 7/10 Only one sachet of regular coffee, and few power points in the room, so I had to get down on all fours to charge my laptop. However, the staff are truly excellent and very helpful.
<LI>Getting There - 6/10 About a 20 minute cab ride from the airport (ca. $40), but conveniently located, and there is a <A href="http://www.microcenter.com">cool PC hardware store</A> down the road.
<LI>Cost - 6/10 - Cheaper rooms around the back of the hotel, nice to have the choice.
<LI>Phone reception - 7/10 - Good reliable signal.
<LI>Internet - 7/10 - Wireless in the rooms, $10 for a day, not too zippy though, need to pay another five bucks to get the fast service.
<LI>Conference facilities - n/a. But they do look pretty good.
<LI>Mushroom factor - 0/10 - city centre location, nothing nearby
