There is an <a href="http://gtpb.igc.gulbenkian.pt/bicourses/KDMC11/">interesting course</a> being run in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oeiras_Municipality,_Portugal">Oeiras</a>, Portugal in July.<br />
<br />
About one hundred million different chemical compounds have already&nbsp;been synthesized. The number of theoretically possible organic&nbsp;molecules exceeds the number of atoms in the universe. This raises a&nbsp;number of questions, including:<br />
<ul><li>Where can one find information about chemical structures and their&nbsp;properties?</li>
<li>How can one efficiently retrieve such information?</li>
<li>Which molecules, if synthesized, could potentially assist the fight&nbsp;against certain types of cancer?</li>
<li>Why is it that some pharmacological targets are considered more&nbsp;promising for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer?s disease than&nbsp;others?</li>
<li>Are there ways to better predict ADME(T) properties of synthesized&nbsp;molecules?</li>
<li>Why does such a significant proportion of launched drugs originate&nbsp;from structures found in natural products?</li>
<li>Why can multi-target pharmacological agents be superior to&nbsp;single-targeted ones?</li>
<li>Can new medical applications be found for old drugs?</li>
<li>Why is the alliance of chemo- and bioinformatics beneficial to the&nbsp;life sciences, biotech and pharma industries?</li>
<li>What are the major challenges facing chemoinformatics now?</li>
</ul>During this course participants will learn how to efficiently find&nbsp;answers to these and many other related questions. Attendees will be&nbsp;instructed in the use of the relevant databases and associated&nbsp;software to:<br />
<ul><li>Represent compounds and (bio)chemical reactions using chemical&nbsp;information in a computer.</li>
<li>Search for information about chemical structures and their&nbsp;properties in public and commercially available databases.</li>
<li>Perform similarity searches with an understanding of the advantages&nbsp;and disadvantages of the various methods.</li>
<li>Prepare data sets for further (Q)SAR/(Q)SPR analysis, estimating the&nbsp;quality and completeness of the data.</li>
<li>Create and validate (Q)SAR/(Q)SPR models for finding and&nbsp;optimization of lead compounds.</li>
<li>Use the above techniques for virtual screening and design of&nbsp;chemical compounds with the required properties.</li>
</ul><b>Target audience</b><br />
Researchers working in life sciences, professionals in the&nbsp;pharmaceutical and biotech industries: organic, medicinal,&nbsp;pharmaceutical chemists, biochemists, molecular biologists,&nbsp;pharmacologists, toxicologists, and others.<br />
