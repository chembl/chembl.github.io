We are planning to hold two half-day (fun) workshops in mid February next year (<i>i.e.</i> the week of February 13th 2012). Aimed at medicinal chemists and molecular modellers - the idea is to develop easy to use workflows for several key tasks that drug discoverers often want to do, and could do more efficiently with the ChEMBL data.<br />
<br />
The workshops will be on campus here at Hinxton, and will start around 10.30am and finish around 3pm (lunch, coffee and cakes will be provided); the focus will be on....<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Day 1 - Use of ChEMBL in lead optimisation</li>
<li>Day 2 - Use of ChEMBL for library design/compound purchase</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
If you are interested in helping, <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBL-og]%20I%20am%20interested%20in%20the%20ChEMBL%20workshops">please mail us</a>, and tell us what session you'd most like to attend. Space will be limited to around 8 attendees.
