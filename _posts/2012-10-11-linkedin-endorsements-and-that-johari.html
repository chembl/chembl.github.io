<br />
So, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> have just started up this endorsement thing, if you've listed some skills, your contacts are variously prompted to endorse/validate you against these skills. A sort of "X-factor", or "Scientist's got Talent"vote.<br />
<br />
A picture of my current endorsements is above - yeah, yeah, stop laughing - it's only been going a few days, and in a couple of weeks everything's gonna be maxed out (I hope).<br />
<br />
I find this whole concept pretty unsettling; for instance, if people have voted for my bioinformatics skills and ignored the chemoinformatics button, does it mean they think I stink at that? Is it a back-handed complement they've just paid me?<br />
<br />
The other odd thing is that my personal perception of my skills is not well correlated with the LinkedIn world's views (hence the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window">Johari Window</a> reference in the title). Perhaps, people don't really see the private underlying enabling skills (<i>e.g</i>. Fortran) that are sublimed into the public facing stuff (<i>e.g.</i> Bioinformatics) we do.<br />
<br />
I know I am obsessive and paranoid, but I know a lot of more obsessive and paranoid (and fragile) people than me, and they are probably losing sleep over this sort of stuff.<br />
<br />
