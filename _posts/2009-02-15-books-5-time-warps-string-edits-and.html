You know what it's like - you have a deadline, stuff that's really important to do, you get your work area ready, and then you browse your bookcase for something interesting. Four hours later, it's time to do something else. Well that was yesterday, and I spent those hours re-reading this old classic. Fairly recently released in a reprinted, and cheaper form. In my opinion, this is one of the best books in sequence comparison, it is full of interesting ideas, has good coverage of related fields of computer science, and a coverage of the algorithms that are deep enough to allow you to go away and start messing around with code.
