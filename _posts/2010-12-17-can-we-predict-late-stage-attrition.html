Having seen todays <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-business/article-23907879-astrazeneca-hopes-for-new-drug-dashed-in-us.do?">surprise regulatory delay</a>&nbsp;on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilinta">ticagrelor</a> - here is an interesting question. 'Is it possible to predict late stage attrition?' By this, I specifically mean is it possible to predict what potential drugs will be approved from a set of recently disclosed USANs. In 2010, there were 101 new USANs assigned (after removing redundancy through parents/salts, different salts, etc). Some of the 2010 USANs will themselves be salts of previous USANs (e.g. ibuprofen sodium), but this will be a small number.<br />
<br />
So given that, on average, that around 20% of these will be eventually approved within the US, is it possible to predict which 20% will become real products?<br />
<br />
If there is interest in a collaborative project (or maybe even a competition ;) ) on this, I will set up a small project area, INCHIs of the structures, etc. Based on historical averages, it will take about four years to get a reasonable readout, but it might be an interesting set of compounds to follow through (a little bit like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_Series">Up Series</a> of documentaries, but for drugs, not kids).
