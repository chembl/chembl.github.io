<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/extra/vsg/"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FkP11HJ3yEA/UmekhAdTWNI/AAAAAAAADLs/1mASbEld2N0/s640/brainothon.tiff" width="640" /></a></div><br />
<a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/extra/vsg/">Here's</a> a small toy app built from the ChEMBL API - really just a technology exemplar - but also pointing towards some interesting potential crowdsourced things that could be done - for example community classification of the drug-likeness of compounds, or the identification of complex toxicophores - the sort of thing where capturing 'expert' tacit knowledge is needed - and the best way to learn is through analysis of examples.<br />
<br />
So, have a play, and see how well you do.<br />
<br />
There's a small interesting story behind this app - I originally thought we should do a dirty hack (a mapped gif - the shame of it) - but no, the development pixies, did a proper job, and in a very short time....<br />
<br />
The first load of the app is slow. So settle down, clear your mind, and get ready to test your skills. The obvious next feature for this is one of those buttons to tweet a score, saying something like - "I got to level 7 on the ChEMBL-brain-O-thon"<br />
<br />
Oh, the url for this won't be stable, and may well disappear completely, so be quick and waste some valuable work time now!<br />
