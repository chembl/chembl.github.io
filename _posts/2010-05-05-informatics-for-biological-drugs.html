The <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/industry/">Industry Programme</a> at the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=2546008714740235720">EMBL-EBI</a> is currently planning a <i>ca.</i> 40 attendee workshop later in the year to cover informatics methods and resources used in the discovery of biological drugs. We currently plan to cover a review of historic biological drug discovery, review attrition for biological drugs, patent databases, mAb structure and engineering, enzyme replacement therapies and replacement therapies, methods to address immunogenicity, solubilised receptors, RNA and aptamer-based therapeutics, <i>etc</i>. Experts from industry and academia will present to the various subjects.<br />
<p>We would greatly <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBL-og]%20I%20have%20some%20ideas%20for%20the%20workshop">welcome ideas</a> for inclusion in the workshop, volunteers for speaking, and so forth, also we would <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBL-og]%20I%20would%20be%20interested%20in%20hearing%20more%20about%20the%20biologicals%20workshop">like to hear from you</a> if you're potentially interested in attending.
