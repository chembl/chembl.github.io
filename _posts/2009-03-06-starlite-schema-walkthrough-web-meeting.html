<P>
The next web-meeting for a walkthrough of the StARlite schema, data model assumptions and sample queries will be at 11am to noon local UK time (so at this time of year GMT/UT) on Friday 20th March. If you wish to take part in this meeting please use <A HREF="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBLog] StARlite web schema walkthrough - number 2">this link</A> (do not modify the header of the email in any way!).
<P>
The last time we tried a web meeting, my domestic broadband connection could not cope with audio and the slides at the same time, so you will need to dial into a UK land line number; unfortunately, this will not be a freephone number.
<P>
Finally, if you can't make this time, we will set up a similar meeting in another few weeks or so.
