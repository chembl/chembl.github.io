An odd title for a post, but hopefully you'll get the point! One of the big problems in our work of curating data from the literature is one of comparing bioassays between papers - there are just so many different possible ways of describing the same thing that making useful links between comparable or incomparable data is very difficult. So for methods sections, wouldn't it be helpful to be able to freely cut and paste text from the works of others describing the protocol for a bioassay (with attribution/citation of course) to allow the linking of data. Of course, this would not be of much help without access to full text, but imagine the future, where links can be established between research on the basis of methodological similarity.
