Well, so are we! If you are interested in applying for a postdoctoral fellowship in our group we would welcome you contacting us for further details. The position would apply text mining approaches across the broad internet to 'discover' interesting disclosures of either compound structures, progression through key clinical development or regulatory milestones, evidence of therapeutic efficacy for a compound/mechanism class <i>etc</i>. This data would be placed into the public domain, and integrated against other data sources, including <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl">ChEMBL</a>, <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</a> and other relevant data sources. You will need to have prior experience of entity recognition within free text, great scripting skills in a language such as perl or python, web analytics, and internet search engines (but hey, who doesn't know how to use <a href="http://www.google.com/">google</a>?). Additionally, experience of chemical structure extraction (image and/or text-based), ontology use/building and data integration and mining skills would be greatly beneficial.<br />
<br />
The fellowship is intended for people wishing to pursue an independent research career, and significant autonomy and responsibility is available.<br />
<br />
So, if you are interested, <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBL-og]%20I%20am%20potentially%20interested%20in%20the%20text%20mining%20project">contact us</a>.
