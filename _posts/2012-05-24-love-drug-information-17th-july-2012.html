An early heads up to a seminar from Andy Bell (now at Imperial College) to be held here on campus, detailing the discovery and development of UK-92,480 (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil">sildenafil</a> and even better known as V1agra and R3vat10). Andy was one of the medicinal chemists and inventors on the PDE-5 inhibitor programme at Pfizer, and the story covers many aspects of drug discovery including, of course, the discovery of the side effect, and also one where the pharmacology led to many new molecular insights into NO signalling and PDE biology.<br />
<br />
There are many myths about the discovery of V1agra, so this is a rare opportunity to hear the exciting story first-hand.<br />
<br />
The seminar &nbsp;is on <b>Tuesday July 17th</b>&nbsp;<b>2012</b> at 2pm in room C209 - you will need to <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBL-og]%20I%20would%20like%20to%20come%20to%20the%20Sildenafil%20talk">mail me</a> in order to get registered with campus security if you don't work on campus. If you do, you can just turn up.<br />
<br />
<u>The presentation will not be webcast, or recorded, or posted on Youtube (sorry).</u>
