We have assembled a large list of antibodies that are, or have been, in clinical development, and have full length sequences for a significant fraction of these. We have available an internship project over the summer to produce a library of structural models for this set of mAbs, and for selected cases to perform docking against their known antigen structures. Applicants should have prior experience of protein structure comparison and analysis, experience of comparative modelling (preferably with Modeller), and ideally experience of protein-protein docking. Additionally experience of antibody structure, CDRs, canonical residues, etc, would be fantastic.<br />
