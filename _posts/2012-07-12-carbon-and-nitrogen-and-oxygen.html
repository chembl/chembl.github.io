There was a <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/carbon-and-oxygen-simples.html">post a few weeks ago</a> about elemental compositions - simple cases of Carbon oxides, nitrogen oxides, <i>etc</i>. Well, I've processed ChEMBL to do the analysis across all of the compounds - very simple analysis - select all formulas of all compounds, select only those that are contain only elements restricted to the set CHNO, and then plot the heavy element (<i>i.e.</i> C N or O) fractions on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot">ternary plot</a>.<br />
<br />
Here it is (click image for larger).<br />

So, the compounds that chemists make are mostly carbon-based, and of course, there's no contours on this version of the plot - hardly a big surprise, that's why they are organic, but things get more interesting when you think about using these data as filters/heuristics for expectation values for the sort of things that chemists could make, for spotting unusual compounds, <i>etc</i>. <i>etc</i>. More later on this...<br />
<br />
Update: Here is the plot for drugs. As you will see there are some differences...<br />
