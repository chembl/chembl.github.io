So, we have updated the data from the usual sources and now have (as of Feb 2010) 244 clinical stage kinase inhibitors. These break down as follows for highest reported clinical phase (however, since many of these inhibitors are for oncology applications, there is a higher fraction than typical of Phase 2 compounds.<br />
