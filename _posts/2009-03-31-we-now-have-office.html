The ChEMBL caravan will always have a place in our hearts, but now we have an office, and we must move on from the pain. It has some walls and a door, with a nice hook for jackets and coats. It is nice, <I>bijou</I> even, and has bought a smile to all our faces. Most importantly it gives us a place to entertain guests and visitors, so if anyone is in the area, please pop by and have a cup 'o tea and a slice 'o cake.
<P>
As a sideline, to fund the tea and cakes, we have a nice T-shirt - XXXL only, minimum order 10 pieces if you are interested.
