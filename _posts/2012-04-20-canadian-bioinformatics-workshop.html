Yesterday, I gave a tutorial in Toronto, Canada on how to use the EBI chemical entities databases as part of the 'Patent Informatics: Sequence &amp; Chemical Databases for Prior Art Searching' workshop. This one day session was organised by the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ca/">Canadian Bioinformatics Workshop</a>. It was held at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, which is situated in downtown Toronto.
It was a very well organised workshop with good facilities and tasty refreshments.
Toronto is a beautiful city and I hope to explore it tomorrow before flying down to Boston to give my talk at Bio-IT World.
