We have set up a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;group for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=3252575">Chembl User Group</a>. Feel free to join if you are interested in connecting up with like-minded scientists,interested in applying ChEMBL to various Life Science problems, hearing about user group meetings, <i>etc</i>. If you are not a member of LinkedIn, have a look around...<br />

I always feel a little bit inadequate when I read some LinkedIn profiles, and some of the elite groups that have been set up; so, as an aside, for when you have a glass of aged port in one hand, a handsome cigar and a fine laptop in the other, try <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating/">this link</a> for an interesting analysis of how people describe themselves on on-line forums and the comparison to cold harsh reality.
