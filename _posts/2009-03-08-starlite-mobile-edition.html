Thanks to the nimble-fingered wizard Mark Halling-Brown, now of the <A HREF="http://www.icr.ac.uk">Institute of Cancer Research</A> I now have a working <A HREF="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</A> version of StARlite 31 on my laptop, and therefore a MySQL distro of the database. Of course, I don't have chemical structure query ability (yet), but it is a step forward. It runs very fast indeed, and is very handy for off-line work, <I>ad hoc</I> demonstrations, and analysis. The laptop spec is a MacBook Pro (early 2009) 2.5GHz, 4GB RAM.
<P>
The picture above is something I picked up from the excellent <A HREF="http://www.pixdaus.com">Pixdaus</A> (I think). It captures the exuberance of youth and celebration - I now only have one of these (not youth!); but it is nonetheless a nice picture. If you are in the photo, and want me to remove it, please let me know.
