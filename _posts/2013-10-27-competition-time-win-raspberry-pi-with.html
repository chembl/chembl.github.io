Here's a <b>free to enter competition</b> for a brand new, fully working raspberry pi running the brand new <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.jp/2013/10/tastypie-on-chempi.html">chempi implementation</a>. It includes everything you need to get started at home with ChEMBL - a sort of <i>in silico</i> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/">Breaking Bad</a> maybe (hopefully not, thinking about it). It includes everything you need, with the exception of a power supply and ethernet cable.<br />
<br />
We have run out of our creative juices, and cannot think of a suitable poem to mark the release of chempi - so the competition is for you to finish a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_(poetry)">limerick</a> for us, starting with the line.<br />
<br />
<i>There once was a hacker with chempi....</i><br />
<br />
Entries must be posted in the comments section. Obscene or defamatory entries will be removed (all comments are moderated, so it may take a few hours for you entry to appear, so do not repost twenty times!). We haven't really decided how to pronounce chempi (with a hard 'k' start or a soft 'sh' start, just as with ChEMBL, both are used in the wild; and also does it rhyme with scampi, or the irrational number pi?). All entries will be assumed to be made under CC-BY licensing. The competition will be open until noon <b>GMT on Sunday 10th November 2013</b>.<br />
<br />
Entires will be judged for compliance to a standard limerick format, outrageous rhymes with chempi, gratuitous chemistry references, and finally humour.<br />
<br />
The judges decision (<i>i.e.</i> mine) is <b>final</b>. The winning entry will be published on the ChEMBL-og.<br />

PS Before I get asked, the competition is not open to members of the ChEMBL group, or extended family members of the ChEMBL group.
