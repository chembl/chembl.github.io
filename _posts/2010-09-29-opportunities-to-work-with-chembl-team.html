We are anticipating engaging two/three contractors to work on a number of very exciting collaborative projects which will significantly augment the content and scope of the ChEMBL data. The work will be located at our facilities here at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus (you will need to have existing right of residence and right to seek employment within the United Kingdom for these contractor positions), and we hope to start work before the winter holiday season. These offer the chance to work within a friendly, Open Access/Open Data team committed to developing novel and innovative precompetitive solutions for private and public sector drug discovery.<br />
<br />
We are looking for creative developers/scientists with existing skills covering significant elements of the following - perl/python, Linux, handling of biological and chemical structural data, ChEMBL, Matlab / Octave / R, MySQL / Oracle / SQL / PL/SQL, GO, MESH, blast,&nbsp;MVC development techniques, UniProt, Pfam, PDBe, Ensembl, Stitch, drug properties, drug targets, DMPK,&nbsp;<i>etc</i>.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in being considered for these contractor positions, please <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBLog]%20Confidential:%20I%20am%20interested%20in%20contracting%20within%20the%20ChEMBL%20group">send us a cv/resume</a>. Any submissions from employment agencies will not be considered, sorry!
