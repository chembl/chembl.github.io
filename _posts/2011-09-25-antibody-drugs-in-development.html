There are a large number of antibody drugs in development - there are about 580 in the current ChEMBL list (<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1306676/Antibody_drugs_in_trials.xls">click here</a> for Excel spreadsheet). I've stripped out some of the fields for clarity, but it should be pretty obvious what everything is.<br />
<br />
So, given that we'll start loading our biological drug sets into ChEMBL shortly, is there any key data missing, as always, any feedback on errors, <i>etc</i> would be greatly appreciated. If anyone would like a file of all the sequences that we have, let me know.<br />
<br />
A couple of notes on the data content<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>There will be some duplication - due primarily to the INNs not being released with Research Code information, whereas from clinicaltrials.gov they typical enter <i>via</i> a Research Code name - after a few months the entries are linked. So any further information on this set would be greatly appreciated....</li>
<li>The Phase number refers to the highest phase I could find the antibody drug reaching in the broad literature - it does not capture current status, and in fact a large number of these will have been abandoned by now.</li>
<li>There are some ambiguities (to me at least) over the USAN year, I use the date the name is published, USAN themselves appear to use a sometimes backdated date, this is probably due to inevitable gaps between assignment of the name and it's publication.</li>
</ul>
