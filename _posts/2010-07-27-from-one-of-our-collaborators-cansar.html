One of our collaborators, <a href="http://www.icr.ac.uk/research/research_profiles/10480.shtml">Bissan Al-Lazikani</a> is building a highly integrated system for cancer target and drug discovery - <a href="http://www.cansar.icr.ac.uk/">canSAR</a>. A pre-release of the Target and Drug Synopsis pages is now available, populated with the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/translation/">Genomics of Drug Sensitivity Project</a> at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, canSAR complements the annotation of the 1000 cell-line screening project.<br />
<br />
Due to the pre-release nature of this component of canSAR, many features have been disabled and removed. The full public release of canSAR will be available later in the year (it is very cool though!).<br />
<br />
canSAR is developed and hosted by the Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics at the <a href="http://www.icr.ac.uk/">Institute of Cancer Research</a>.
