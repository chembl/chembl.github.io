We'll be running a ChEMBL database schema walkthrough at 3pm GMT on Thursday 27th January.<br />
<br />
There will be some changes to the existing schema in the forthcoming ChEMBL_09 release, to allow us to incorporate a lot more information about approved drugs. Therefore this webinar may be of interest not just to new users, wishing to understand the schema/data model, but also existing users who want more information about the changes.<br />
<br />
We will use <a href="https://www.webhuddle.com/">webhuddle</a> for the meeting. You don't need an account or any software, just a Java enabled web-browser. There will also be a separate number to dial into the audio.<br />
