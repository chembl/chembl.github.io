I was just comparing the built in page view stats tools in <a href="http://www.blogger.com/home">google's blogger software</a> and the stats in <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">google analytics</a>. The former is server side, but they do prune access from spam site (I think), the latter is relies on interactions with the client, cookies, <i>etc</i>. so in the toy way I understand teh interweb, I see this as 'client' side. It's really simple to configure things so that google analytics doesn't track access, and quite a few people do.<br />
<br />
So here's an interesting number - from July 1st 2011 to today, there were 184,035 page views (~710 per day) for this blog in google bloggers stats for chembl.blogspot.com, and only 55,435 page views in google analytics (~214 per day) - don't laugh at how small the numbers are, but now you know. Anyway, google analytics is about 3.3 fold down on actual page views.<br />
<br />
I'm sure all bloggers look at their stats, so is this ratio typical?
