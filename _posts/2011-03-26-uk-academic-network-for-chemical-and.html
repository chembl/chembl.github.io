This Network will establish an Academia-Users Network in Chemical Biology to initiate, establish and nurture collaborative projects for the advancement of the drug discovery process. It aims to expand the capability of UK drug discovery, with new drug targets, new tools to validate targets and new multidisciplinary partnerships to explore the platforms, tools and targets of the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
A poster for this new network is above, but a website is being set-up for this, and as soon as it is ready to go, we'll provide links on the ChEMBL-og.<br />
<br />
The network is funded by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/">BBSRC</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/">MRC</a>,  funded through their joint “Collaborative Networks in Chemical Biology” initiative.
