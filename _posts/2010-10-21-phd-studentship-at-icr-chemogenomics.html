We have a studentship on applying chemogenomics and in-silico network biology to discover new cancer drug targets from siRNA screening data. Details on the project can be found <a href="http://www.icr.ac.uk/education/science_students_opportunities/studentships/available_studentships/16328.shtml">here</a>.<br />
<br />
The student will be imbedded within the Cancer Therapeutics Unit in Sutton, with time spent at the Chlesea ICR site in Dr. Marketa Zvelebil's team. This is an exciting studentship because it is applying the two exciting fields of chemogenomics and network biology, and working very closely with biologists and chemists with the ICR.  New cancer targets discovered have the opportunity to be validated and progressed within the Cancer Therapeutics Unit.<br />
<br />
This is a four year MRC funded research studentship, please check you are <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Fundingopportunities/Applicanthandbook/Studentships/Eligibility/index.htm">eligible</a> before applying.
