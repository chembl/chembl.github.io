We post some reviews of hotels that we stay at on our professionally related travels under the Hit-The-Sack tag. These are our <B>personal experiences</B> of a stay at the hotel from the <B>perspective of a visiting scientist</B> (so the views expressed are not those of a typical visitor to the hotel, and may not even be those of a typical scientist!). Over time, they may be useful for trip planning, or just reminding us of some of the good times.
<P>
As you would expect, the rooms we stay in are not suites or other types of luxury rooms. The room score and discussion refers to the actual room stayed in for that visit. The dates in the blog reported do not necessarily reflect those that the stay in the hotel occurred. However, we always try and post as contemporaneously as possible.
<P>
The pictures of the hotels are (usually) taken from simple Google image searches, and may be covered by copyright. If this is a concern, please contact me, and I will replace/delete the photo.
