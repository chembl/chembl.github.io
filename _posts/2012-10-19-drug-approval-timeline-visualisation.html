We're playing around with some visualisation techniques at the moment for ChEMBL, with one of our interests being the display of timelines. <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/extra/drug_timeline/drugs_timeline.html">Here</a> is a little standalone visualisation of the timeline of FDA drug approvals, annotated with ATC codes, loaded with some toy data (so don't rely on it for structures/publications/analysis!).<br />

<u>Update</u>: So the toolkit we use looks to be quite browser sensitive - we'll look into this, but by default, it looks like it doesn't render in Chrome.....
