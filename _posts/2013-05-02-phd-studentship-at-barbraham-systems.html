<span style="font-family: inherit;">Our friendly neighbours at <a href="http://www.babraham.ac.uk/">The Babraham Institute</a><span style="font-size: small;"> are looking for a PhD candidate to work on systems pharmacology models, as
part of a collaboration between the Le Novère (Babraham), the Hermjakob (EMBL-EBI) and the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. The&nbsp;</span>Le Novère group<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>uses quantitative computational models to understand cellular and
molecular processes, and develop community services that facilitate research in computational systems
biology (<a href="http://lenoverelab.org/">http://lenoverelab.org</a>).</span><br />

<span style="font-family: inherit;">One of the major challenges of drug discovery is to demonstrate the efficacy of a potential new
drug. This goes beyond the development of a potent molecule - it also implies a good
understanding of the biological context, how it relates to a particular disease, and the drug's
mechanism of action. The availability of relevant Systems Pharmacology models can therefore have
a significant impact. The most comprehensive repository of Systems Biology models in machine
readable language is <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels">BioModels</a> Database, created by Le Novère and maintained at the EBI. In spite
of its extensive collection, BioModels Database only covers a fraction of the Systems Pharmacology
models described in the literature. In addition, no analysis has been performed on how they map
to druggable targets and/or disease mechanisms.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
The candidate will:&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Use state-of-the-art
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: 700;">text-mining methods </span>to extract and analyse the space of <span style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: 700;">Systems Pharmacology models </span>currently
described in the literature, with particular emphasis to their relevance to druggable targets and
disease mechanisms;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: 700;">Identify the models </span>offering the best opportunities for the discovery of
new drugs, and <span style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: 700;">incorporate them into BioModels Database</span>;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Explore and <span style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: 700;">assess the
applicability of those models </span>to real drug development cases, evaluating their quality, advantages,
caveats, overlaps, gaps and impact on the demonstration of drug efficacy against specific
indications.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
The candidate must have an extensive knowledge of molecular biology and pharmacology, and
solid basis in numerical analysis and statistics. Advanced familiarity with data representation and
programming skills will also be desirable.
