The European Commission and EFPIA (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations) has recently announced the 2nd round of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) scheme, the amount of funding available is quite substantial, but arguably more important to the research community is the embracing of open data and services, and in particular coordinated pre-competitive activities (there is a lovely recent paper on these sort of activities <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v8/n9/full/nrd2944.html">here</A>, a subscription may be required)
