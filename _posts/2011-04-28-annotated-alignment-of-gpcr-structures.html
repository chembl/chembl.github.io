There are now a <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/p/gpcr-structures.html">large number of GPCR structures known</a> and freely available from resources such as <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe">PDBe</a>. We are starting to add structural and binding site content to <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/sarfari/gpcrsarfari">GPCR SARfari</a>, and as part of this preparing a series of alignments, overlaps, <i>etc</i>.<br />
<br />
Click this <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/extra/joy.html">link</a> for a structure-annotated sequence alignment (using <a href="http://tardis.nibio.go.jp/joy/">joy</a>) of current GPCR structures (as of April 2011). This representation is quite useful for identifying structurally variable regions, helix caps, and so forth. As you would expect for proteins of this divergence and degree of inherent flexibility, there are some ambiguities in the alignment.
