The 2011 set of USANs is almost complete, there are 114 of them, but some of these are salts of others, so the total number of distinct potential new drugs is smaller - actually 87 - this is smaller number that previous years. The breakdown by molecule class is quite interesting - remember this set comprise potential future approved drugs, and so, depending on the attrition within each set, the drugs of about three or four years time will look like these.<br />
<br />
Small molecules still dominate the set, with almost three quarters of USANs in this class - biologicals are just over one quarter of the cohort.<br />
<br />
By rough breakdown, I mean just this, I got out a pencil and a few printed lists and tallied them up - a bigger and better controlled analysis will be posted later.
