A new hotel for me. Near to the NIH in Bethesda, and overall a 40% score.

<LI>Room quality - 4/10 not much coffee supplied for the machine in the room, no toilet roll!, and too close to the lifts. But a good sized bed.
<LI>Getting there - 3/10 - a half hour cab ride from Dulles, about 50 bucks, I needed to tell the driver where it was though.
<LI>Cost - 5/10 - $219 for the night.
<LI>Phone reception - 7/10, excellent cell phone coverage, but if only I could afford data roaming while in the US.
<LI>Internet - 5/10 only wired access in room, and about $13 for a days access - it is fast though, and no need to fiddle with smtp ports.
<LI>Conference facilities - n/a did not use them
<LI>Mushroom factor - 0/10 seems miles away from any woods, but wrong time of year to judge anyway.
