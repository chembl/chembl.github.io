</div><p>Of course, the <a href="http://www.nature.com/">Nature journal</a> is fantastic, but I was thinking of Nature, as in Mother, here. I came across this picture on the BBC news site. The original image (at an incredible 250m pixel size) is at <a HREF="http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/?2010007-0107/GreatBritain.A2010007.1150.250m.jpg">http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/?2010007-0107/GreatBritain.A2010007.1150.250m.jpg</A><br />
