It's sometimes difficult to trace the approval process for drugs in 'foreign' countries - of course, foreign is relative, but nonetheless as a non-local it is difficult to know where to start. As an example, I tried a number of 'social media' approaches to find out about Chinese Drug non-proprietary naming - Quora, Google+ the ChEMBL-og and LinkedIn - <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> was by far the best in terms of useful leads and information, often from 2nd or 3rd away links. Thanks to all that helped so far.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's a website in Japan which contains a definitive list of Japanese Drug Approvals, and which has sections in the English language to help non-Japanese readers/speakers.<br />
<br />
It's the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency, Japan, website -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pmda.go.jp/">http://www.pmda.go.jp/</a>&nbsp;with an English version at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pmda.go.jp/english/">http://www.pmda.go.jp/english/</a><br />
<br />
There are convenient, yearly approval summaries, in English -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pmda.go.jp/english/service/list_s.html">http://www.pmda.go.jp/english/service/list_s.html</a><br />
<br />
Package inserts are here&nbsp;<a href="http://www.info.pmda.go.jp/info/iyaku_index.html">http://www.info.pmda.go.jp/info/iyaku_index.html</a> (Japanese only).<br />
<br />
As a general comment, I find the websites for the primary US and European drug approval agencies (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/">www.fda.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.emea.europa.eu/">www.emea.europa.eu</a>) to be very complex to use, have unstable links (so things can move around and disappear), have no obvious site maps, or ways of retrieving data in a programmatic/hackamatic way - which given that these are obvious cases where opening up and ready availability of public/government data is surprising. The ability to link in to these sites is essential, and at the moment, can't be reliably done.<br />
<br />
As an aside, there's a very good database in the UK - <a href="http://www.ukmi.nhs.uk/default.asp">UK Medicines Information</a>, which, unfortunately is only available to NHS employees, or other associated staff (presumably for licensing reasons?). However, a lot of the post-sign-in content is indexed in&nbsp;well known search engines - you just need to know what you are looking for ;)
