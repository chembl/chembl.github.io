Here is a call for assistance, all input will end up published on <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/">The ChEMBL-og</a>, and accessible to one-and-all. What we're looking for is a pretty comprehensive list of key clinical candidate disclosure meetings, ideally those with disclosure of chemical structure, functional assay, pharmacokinetic and toxicology data - you know the sort of meeting, where the key data on a hot compound is disclosed for the first time.<br />
<br />
I've put together a preliminary list <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/p/large-scientific-meetings-and.html">here</a>, from memory and a little bit of googling - this is far, far, far from perfect and is woefully incomplete, and am now looking for addition of extra meetings for the areas not covered, and some highlighting of additional ones. As you will see I've used the ATC classification for the structure of the list - although this is not perfect for things like anti-microbials, etc., it is actually a pretty good framework to hang this off.<br />
<br />
If you have any suggestions, please <a href="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBLog]%20Here%20are%20some%20ideas%20for%20key%20clinical%20candidate%20disclosure%20meetings">mail them in</a>....<br />
<br />
Finally, if you are interested in hearing our plans, and maybe collaborating on some informatics aspect of this, feel free to contact us.
