</div>The 2010 EMBO Chemical Biology meeting to be held in Heidelberg is shaping up very well - excellent speakers, really exciting portfolio of international chemical biology research, etc, but it is now only two months away, however some places are still available for attendees. Links to the conference details are <a href="http://www.embl.de/training/courses_conferences/conference/2010/CHB10-01/">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Of course, several of the ChEMBL group will be there, and so if you'd like to meet any of us there, hear about our plans for the databases, or know more about research, drop us a line.
