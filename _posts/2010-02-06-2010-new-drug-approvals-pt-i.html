The first FDA approval of this year is Tocilizumab, approved on January 8th, under the trade name Actemra. Tocilizumab is a first-in-class <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P08887">interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor</a>-inhibiting monoclonal antibody drug, and is indicated for the treatment of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a> in adults who have had an inadequate response to one or more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNF">tumor necrosis factor (TNF)</a> antagonist therapies. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic and debilitating, systematic inflammatory disorder, which affects principally synovial tissues.  Tocilizumab ATC code is <a href="http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=L04AC07">L04AC07</a>.  Tocilizumab works by blocking the signalling of IL-6, an immune system soluble <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine">cytokine</a> that is overproduced in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Other biological therapies for RA include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_alpha">tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)</a> blockers (<i>e.g,</i> Golimumab), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_1">IL-1 blockers</a> (<i>e.g.</i>, Anakinra), monoclonal antibodies against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell">B cells</a> (e.g., Rituximab) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell">T cell</a> costimulation inhibitors (<i>e.g.</i>, Abatacept). However, all these act through binding to different target molecules. Others drugs with the same IL-6R binding mechanism as Tocilizumab are ALD518 and CNTO-136, which are currently reported to be in Phase II clinical trials.    Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin IgG1κ subclass. Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R) - mIL-6R is also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD126">CD126</a>. Tocilizumab has a molecular weight of <span style="font-style: italic;">ca.</span> 148 kDa, with a volume of distribution of ~6.4L, a linear clearance of ~12.5 mL/h and a half-life up to 13 days. The recommended starting dosage is ~4 mg/kg followed by an increase to ~8 mg/kg based on clinical response, administrated as a single intravenous drip infusion over 1 hour, every 4 weeks. Interestingly, Tocilizumab, <i>via</i> blocking cytokine signalling can affect expression levels of a wide variety of CYP450 drug metabolizing enzymes, leading to the potential for drug-drug interactions.    The full prescribing information for Tocilizumab can be found <a href="http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/actemra/pdf/pi.pdf">here</a>.    Tocilizumab has a boxed warning (Risk of serious infections).    Each light and heavy chain of Tocilizumab  consists of 214 and 448 amino acids, respectively, and the four polypeptide chains are linked intra- and inter-molecularly by disulfide bonds.    The license holder of Tocilizumab is <a href="http://www.gene.com/">Genentech, Inc.</a> and the product website is <a href="http://www.actemra.com/">www.actemra.com</a>.
