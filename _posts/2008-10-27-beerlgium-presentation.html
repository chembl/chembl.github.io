I am off to Brussels on the 30th October to speak at the excellent looking Be Live IT conference. I will outline the new ChEMBL resources, and hopefully also present some of the differences between the private and public funded sectors for this field. The speakers after me look very good. <A HREF="http://www.belieit.be">Link to conference website</A>
