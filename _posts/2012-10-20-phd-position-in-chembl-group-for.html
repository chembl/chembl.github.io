<br />
We have a PhD position available in the group for an October 2013 start. Details of the EMBL PhD Programm (EIPP) can be found <a href="http://www.embl.de/training/eipp/">here</a>, with more details on stipend <i>etc</i>. <a href="http://www.embl.de/training/eipp/fellowships/index.html">here</a>. Students at the EBI are also typically registered at the University of Cambridge, and fully participate in college life with access to all the facilities of the University. Several other PIs at the EBI, and the rest of EMBL have positions available, so these may be of interest too.<br />
<br />
The project areas we are interested in for the ChEMBL group are connected to computational approaches to drug discovery or drug safety. However, being part of EMBL gives students access to great experimental facilities, and we regularly collect data sets useful for our work, or test and validate predictions. We have a few ideas at the moment that would be suitable for a PhD project, including...<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Reconstruction of assay cascades from ChEMBL.</li>
<li>Is the concept of a 'disease pathway' a useful one?</li>
<li>Automated design and optimization of biological drugs using a rule-based approach.</li>
<li>Polypharmacology, Compound Promiscuity and Drug Safety.</li>
<li>The structural basis of allosteric regulation.</li>
</ul>
<br />
But proposals for other areas of research are very welcome.<br />
<br />
The deadline for applications is the <b>19th November 2012</b>, but you need to register for the online registration system by the <b>12th November 2012</b>. Interviews will be in Hinxton on the 6th to 8th February 2013.<br />
