During the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/handson/course_110214_smallbioactives.html">Small Molecule Bioactivity</a> course we hosted earlier in the year, and in a number of subsequent ChEMBL webinars, we've been asked if it is possible to use these new services in <a href="http://accelrys.com/products/pipeline-pilot/">Pipeline Pilot</a>, the short answer is <b>yes</b>. <br />
<br />
To help users get started we have created a simple protocol, which you can <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/extra/chembl_rest_example.xml">download</a>, use and modify (the license for this, for those interested is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>). Remember to save the file on your disk - the link itself will look goofy in your browser. The protocol will retrieve data for a list of ChEMBLids and return a list of bioactivity and compound data in an html table.<br />
<br />
We will be interested to hear how you get on, so tell us about any changes/enhancements you would make to the protocol, we're convinced it can be improved. <br />
<br />
Over the coming months you can expect the set of ChEMBL Web Services to grow. We will keep you informed of any new additions <i>via</i> this blog, the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/index.php/ws">website</a> and the <a href="http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/chembl-announce">chembl-announce</a> mailing list.
