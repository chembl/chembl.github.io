We have penned into our diaries the dates of <b>Monday February 14th 2011 thru Friday&nbsp;</b><b>February 18th 2011</b> for the second ChEMBL residential training course. This will be held on campus here at Hinxton, registration and details of the sessions to be covered will appear on the EBI website shortly.<br />
<br />
2010 year was our first course, and we had to prepare a lot of material, <i>etc</i>. but we really enjoyed it, and the 2011 course will be even better.<br />
