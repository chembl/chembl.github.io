A brief alert to a Wellcome Trust <A HREF="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Professional-resources/Courses-and-conferences/Advanced-Courses/Courses/WTX041285.htm">course</A> being held here on campus this July.
<P>
And while we are on the subject of conferences, the <A HREF="http://www.rsc.org">RSC</A> is organising a meeting on the 1st October 2009 on 'Chemical Tools and Challenges in Systems Biology' to be held in Stevenage in the U.K.. jpo is speaking at this meeting on the ChEMBL project. There is nothing on the RSC website yet, but it looks like it should be a good meeting.
