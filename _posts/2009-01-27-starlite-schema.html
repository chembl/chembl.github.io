The StARlite database has a very simple schema, and should be easy to integrate other resources against. I have had a couple of requests for the schema, so <A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/downloads/SCHEMA_2009ext.png">here it is</A>, in its current form. It may change a little, but not much, as we align it against other <A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk">EMBL-EBI</A> resources.
<P>
We will also arrange a web meeting, probably at 8pm GMT on Thursday 5th Feb to talk through the data model and schema, describe some sample queries, <I>etc.</I>, for those interested, <A HREF="mailto:jpo@ebi.ac.uk?subject=[ChEMBLog] StARlite schema walkthrough">mail me</A> to get further details.
