<br />
Following the scientific literature is a difficult task, it's not something you can do lying on the beach. Among the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2013%2F04%2F24%3A2013%2F04%2F25+%5Bedat%5D">huge number of articles that are published&nbsp;every day</a>&nbsp;only a few really matter to you. These are the articles you are going to have the time to read and that are relevant to your research.<br />
<br />
In order to spot the relevant papers, there are a number of thematic approaches. For example, most journals publish articles in a relatively restricted field - and so a scientist can follow a thematic journal (like PLOS, Nature&nbsp;Biotechnology, <i>etc</i>). But then you'll still receive a lot of information to be sorted and you will obviously notice only the recent work. Maybe that interesting article you are waiting for has been published 5 years ago and you will then never ever notice it that way.<br />
<br />
You can also keep track of literature with a keywords search (that you save somehow). This approach presents some problems too: What keywords should you search for? Your research is certainly more complex and subtle than "cancer p53" or "sequence analysis".<br />
<br />
<a href="http://pubmed-watcher.org/">PubMed Watcher</a> is an experimental tool designed to help biomedical scientists to read&nbsp;efficiently&nbsp;adequate literature. The tool is built based on the following assumptions:<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Relevant&nbsp;papers are forever: PubMed Watcher abstracts away from the publishing date.</li>
<li>Relevant&nbsp;papers are everywhere: The tool considers all the articles indexed by PubMed.</li>
<li>Your research cannot be defined by a few keywords only: PubMed Watcher relies on <i>Key Articles</i> as a means to express the science you care about.</li>
</ul>

More details and the methodology behind the tool is presented <a href="http://pubmed-watcher.org/about/">here</a> alongside an example to illustrate how it works.</div>
