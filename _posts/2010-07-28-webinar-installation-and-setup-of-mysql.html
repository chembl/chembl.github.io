We are planning to run a web tutorial on the installation and set-up of a local MySQL version of ChEMBL. This will allow very flexible querying of the data within ChEMBL (with the exception of chemical structure searching for which there is currently no freely available cartridge/plugin (yet)). We will do an entire download and install of MySQL, download of the ChEMBL data, and setting everything up, then doing some sample queries - all within one hour.<br />
<br />
The web meeting will be from 3pm to 4pm UK time (we are on BST at the moment) on Thursday 5th August.
