</div>One of my secret pleasures of the past used to be when the OHE published a new monograph on healthcare, I'd pick up a free copy from the library, and read it on the bus journey home. Often, they were connected to things like, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year">QALYs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALY">DALYs</a>, which although interesting were not directly relevant to what I do; however, every now and then there was a real gem; for example, comparing structural differences between the UK and German biotech sectors, or re-costing the development costs of a new drug, or capturing the unexpected benefits on drug research (drug repurposing, <i>etc</i>). The monographs were great because they bought together scientific and healthcare innovation with well argued economic cases - a sort of science meets economics meets patients view, which is quite refreshing and rare.<br />
<br />
The OHE went quiet for a few years (for me at least), but on the new website <a href="http://www.ohe.org/">www.ohe.org</a> there are a bunch of cool, free things from a drug discovery perspective. A good example is the monograph on <a href="http://www.ohe.org/publications/recent-publications/list-by-title-20/detail/date////new-drugs-to-tackle-antimicrobial-resistance-analysis-of-eu-policy-options.html">New Drugs To Tackle Antimicrobial Resistance</a>.
