<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">One of our Industry Programme members passed on a listing for some positions they are looking to fill at the new center in Heidelberg - BioMed X. It looks like it may be of interest to many of the ChEMBL-og readers, so I thought I would post it here....</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">They are looking for a Computational Chemistry/Drug Design group leader for a project "Development of a design software of SELECTIVE
kinase inhibitors". The <a href="http://www.bio.mx/">BioMed X Innovation Center</a> in Heidelberg, Germany, constitutes a new class of incubator at the interface between academia and industry where top life science talents from all over the world are jointly working on biomedical innovation outside the pharma box. Young talents from leading academic institutions world-wide are selected in annual assessment centers based on their scientific expertise, creative energy, and passion for product-oriented pre-clinical research &amp; development. Interdisciplinary project teams are collaborating in an open-innovation lab facility in Heidelberg with guidance of experienced mentors from academia and industry while expanding their scientific network and receiving an intensive entrepreneurship and leadership training.</span><br />
