Iloperidone is an antipsychotic agent indicated for the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Iloperidone displays broad polypharmacology, acting as an antagonist at <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P14416">dopamine D2</a> (Ki of 6.3 nM) and <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P35462">dopamine D3</a> (Ki of 7.1 nM), <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P28223">serotonin 5-HT2A</a> (Ki of 5.6 nM), dopamine D4 (Ki 25 nM), 5HT6 (Ki of 43 nM), 5HT7 (Ki of 22 nM) and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (Ki of 36nM) (phew!) and belongs to the general class of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic">atypical antipsychotics</a>. Lower affinities, but also probably relavent for the clinical pharmacology, are observed at the 5HT1A, D1 and H1 receptors). Iloperidone is a small molecule drug (Molecular Weight of 426.5 g.mol-1), is fully Rule-of-Five compliant, lipophilic and pratically insoluble in water and has good oral absorption (96% bioavailable). Iloperidone has a plasma half-life of 18 hours, a volume of distribution of 1,340-2,800L and plasma protein binding of ~95%.
<p>
Iloperidone elimination is mainly through CYP dependent hepatic metabolism (specifically CYP3A4 and CYP2D6); some of these metabolites are themselves pharmacologically active. CYP2D6 is an example of a genetically variable gene, with a fraction of the population having a form of the gene that is significantly less active - so called 'slow metabolizers', this generally leads to variability of drug response. Iloperidone has an apparent clearance of 47-102 L/hour, with the bulk of the clearance being renal (<i>i.e..</i> the drug is excreted in the urine). The recommended dosage is 12 to 24 mg/day administrated twice daily (equivalent to <i>ca.</i> 28-56uM). Like many drugs of this class, there are a broad range of potential adverse events, including a propensity for the compound to increase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval">QTc interval</a>.

</p><p>
Iloperidone has a boxed warning (colloquially known as a 'black box').
</p><p>
Iloperidone belongs to the chemical class of piperidinyl-benzisoxazole derivatives - the piperidine in the six membered ring containing the nitrogen in the middle of the molecule, while the benzisoxazole is the fused five-six dual ring structure at the bottom left. Its structure 4'-[3-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)piperidino]propoxy]-3'-methoxyacetophenone contains a tertiary amine which makes the molecule basic, but otherwise the molecule is largely lipophilic in character. A relatively unusual chemical feature for a drug is the presence of the aryl-ketone group.
