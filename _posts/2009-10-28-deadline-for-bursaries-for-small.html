The deadline for application for bursaries for the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/handson/course_100125_smallmolecules.html#about">small molecule bioactivity course</a> at the EMBL-EBI is approaching - Friday November 6th. If you wish to attend for free (or at a really discounted rate) please consider applying now. We are starting to assemble the material for the course now, and have secured some truly outstanding external speakers - it should be good!
