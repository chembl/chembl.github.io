I thought I would post a note on the <A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/industry/about/about-industry-programme.html">EMBL-EBI's Industry Programme</A>. This is a forum open to all life-science companies to network and understand the tools, resources and direction of the EMBL-EBIs activities, and also encourage discussion of pre-competitive and collaborative activities between life-science companies. Given the increasing demands for cost-reduction, data integration and knowledge representation within the sector this activity is becoming increasingly important. Details of how to join the can be found on the EMBL-EBI web-site (link above). An analogous group exists for smaller companies (SME/SMBs).
