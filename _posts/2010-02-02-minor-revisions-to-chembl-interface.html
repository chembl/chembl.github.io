We have a big list of things to fix, a bigger list of things to think about, and despite thinking three weeks ago that we would never want to do the course again, are now looking forward to it again next year.<br />
<br />
We have made some minor interface changes, available at <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/index.php/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/index.php/</a><br />

Frr those of you waiting for the interface/database webinars, something will be announced soon...
