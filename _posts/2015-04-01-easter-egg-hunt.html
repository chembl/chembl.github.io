Easter is coming and for all those, who don't know what to do with their spare time and fancy entering a little competition, we've prepared a small challenge.<br />
<br />
<b>Easter Egg?</b><br />
<br />
In software development, an Easter egg is funny (but harmless) and undocumented feature hidden from users in unusual places. Excel 97 has its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gYb5GUs0dM">Flight Simulator</a>, FireFox <a href="about:robots">about:robots</a> address and Debian's <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">apt-get</span> has a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/56125"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">moo</span></i></a> command. The <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/new-chembl-web-services.html">ChEMBL web services</a> has now joined this list and we invite you to find its hidden feature and share with others.<br />
<br />
<b>But why?</b><br />
<br />
We would like to encourage you to look at the <a href="https://github.com/chembl/chembl_webservices_2">source code</a> of our web services.&nbsp; Reading code is essential developer skill, as it helps in understanding how the code works. This can lead to the development of new software and/or improve an existing codebase. After skimming through the code, hopefully you will agree that it is well written and easy to extend. Let us know if you disagree, either by <a href="mailto:chembl-help@ebi.ac.uk">emailing us</a> or creating a <a href="https://github.com/chembl/chembl_webservices_2/issues">GitHub issue</a>. We promise, there are no dragons there, only an Easter egg, which should be easy to find after reading the code.<br />
<br />
<b>How?</b><br />
<br />
The first person to comment on this post with a URL revealing the Easter egg (web service URL, hmm hint maybe?), will be honoured with a mention in a future blog post. As a 'guarantee', that the Easter egg exists now, we provide the following <a href="http://thinfi.com/lg8">password protected URL</a> - we will reveal the password, the winner and more details in the follow up blog post. Do you think you can do it? Check it out!<br />
<br />
<b>Is this an April fool joke?</b><br />
<br />
No. The joke is in having an Easter egg, not in finding it.<br />
