Day 324 of my holiday (or that's what it feels like) and I'm missing making graphs - so I revisited Numbers, the Apple spreadsheet program, trying to get some pivot table sort of plots from a spreadsheet - it was a pain, but here is a view of kinase inhibitors that have reached clinical trials, grouped by company. Click the image above to see it larger. The labels should be read from left to right, and so Pfizer (and their acquired companies) has developed the most kinase inhibitors, then Roche (and their acquired companies) the next most, <i>etc</i>. It's interesting to see the ubiquitous power law at operation here, with nine companies accounting for over half of the kinase inhibitors to have entered clinical trials.<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to normalise these values by total R&amp;D spend, and so reflect companies that are kinase specialists (I don't have this data), but a few standouts are <a href="http://www.exelixis.com/" target="_blank">Exelixis</a>, <a href="http://www.takeda.com/" target="_blank">Takeda</a>, <a href="http://www.arraybiopharma.com/" target="_blank">Array</a> and <a href="http://www.astx.com/" target="_blank">Astex Therapeutics</a>.<br />
<br />
Oh, the data also includes the rolimus MTOR inhibitors....<br />
<br />
<u>Update</u> - Since making the figure, I came across another compound from Lilly, and then by looking at their pipeline website (which is now new and fancy looking, but not so good for scraping) found some more Lilly compounds. So the total number of kinase inhibitors used to generate this data is 379, and Lilly have jumped in position (the figure has been replaced with the new version).
