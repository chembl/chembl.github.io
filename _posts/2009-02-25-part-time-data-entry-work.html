We need some people to perform <I>ad hoc</I> data entry/quality control work. There will probably be about 5 hours, or so, a week per person, with payment on an hourly rate. Good understanding of the scientific literature, a methodical manner, excellent ability with technical english, the ability to draw chemical structures, and also high familiarity with Microsoft Excel is essential.
<P>
You must have your own computer, software and internet connection.
<P>
The ability to enter into a contract, and to receive payment in a conventional manner is absolutely essential.
<P>
<B>Thanks for all the interest in this, we now have enough applicants</B>
