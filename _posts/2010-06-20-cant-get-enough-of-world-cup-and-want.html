I have been watching all the 2010 World Cup matches here in Korea, with Korean commentary (what day is it exactly?), but now when I turn the television off, the world sounds strangely quiet, unsettling, and to be perfectly frank, a little scary.<br />
<p>However, I've found a simple solution through the magic of teh interwebs (you will need your sound enabled on your computer).<br />
