As regular users will rapidly see, there is a completely new tabbed interface structure, and many other enhancements scattered over many parts of the system.<br />
<p>We also greatly appreciate the reporting of any errors in the data contained within the database - so please keep it up, your work benefits the entire community.<br />
<p>We are also making progress on porting the chemical infrastructure to the fantastic <a href="http://orchem.sourceforge.net/">OrChem</a> Open Source chemistry plugin for Oracle databases. An Open Access publication for OrChem can be found <A href="http://www.jcheminf.com/content/1/1/17">here</a>. Watch this space for more news.
