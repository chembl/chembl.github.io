Sorry. If you want to obtain samples of chembl compounds you do have a number of options: 1) Often the underlying literature contains a synthetic route and reagents for the compounds, this greatly helps resynthesis. 2) About 5-10% of chembl compounds are reported to be available from compound vendors (for example, you could search databases such as the excellent <a HREF="http://zinc.docking.org">ZINC</A> to find available compounds). However, the turnover of stock from compound vendors is quite high, and often a significant fraction of compounds reported to be available for purchase will be out of stock when you want them.
