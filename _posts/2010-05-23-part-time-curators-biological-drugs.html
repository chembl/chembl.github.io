We are looking to appoint a part-time, home-based curator to cover biological drugs for the Open Access, Open Data drug discovery database ChEMBL. The role will require some previous experience of biological drug discovery and development, and a broad familiarity with the field. The biological drug portion of ChEMBL covers all classes of 'biotechnology' drugs, <i>e.g.</i> mAbs, aptamers, enzymes, peptides, solubilised receptors, <i>etc</i>. You will need to have your own computer and software (Excel, or OpenSource equivalent), bioinformatics experience, an investigative mind, and an eye for detail and thoroughness.<br />
