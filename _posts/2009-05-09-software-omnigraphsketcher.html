Here is a software tool that I can't believe didn't exist before - maybe it did, and I didn't know, but it is good - as good as an apple pie, that tastes very nice.
<P>
Many times there is the need to produce illustrative graphs, annotated graphs of imported data, etc. This is a tool that almost does everything I need, Having the ability to do pie-charts would make this perfect, maybe it does them and  I haven't found the options yet. But compared to how I struggle with Excel's graphing options sometimes, this is a different world.
<P>
There are some videos of <A HREF="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraphsketcher/">OmniGraphSketcher</A> on the <A HREF="http://www.omnigroup.com">OmniGroup</A> website, that show its capabilities pretty well. The software is licensed, but comes with a generous 30 day free trial, and the price is $29.95 for a full license. Student <B>and faculty</B> (Yey!!) discounts are available, as is a family pack and volume discounts. So students with large families, will get an incredibly keen price.
