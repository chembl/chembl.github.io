We are interested in benchmarking recovery of 2-D chemical structures from 'real-world' photos. So if anyone has things that they have captured at conferences from slides or posters, or fancy taking pcitures from a poster, journal, powerpoint projection, <i>etc</i>. that they'd be willing to donate as samples, that would be great.<br />
<br />
Specifically, we are investigating in building a pipeline using some image processing to condition the images and then the wonderful OSRA for the image to 2-D conversion. Having a broad range of cameras, lighting conditions and so forth would be great, (especially from a range of portable devices). We'll also put together for this set, the correct structures, and so it may be useful to a broader community. This will all be available under a CC0 license if we gather sufficient material.<br />
<br />
So post away in the comments, or mail us directly with any images you may have.<br />
<br />
<u>Update - thanks for the photos you've mailed in so far. Good start - we'll update you in the future as to how we've got on.</u>
