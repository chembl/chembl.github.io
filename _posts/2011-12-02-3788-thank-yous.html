So a big and heart-felt three thousand, seven hundred and eighty eight 'Thank Yous' to all the benevolent donors to the EBI Movember Team - <i>The Bioinformoustachians</i>. It was a lot of fun, the place is a lot hairier now, and there are more smiles on faces than at the start of the month.<br />
<br />
Mission accomplished by our International (hair)peace keeping force - The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_cross">Victoria</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cross">George Crosses</a> (respectively) are awarded to Francesco Iorio (sgt. 8th Italian light foot) and Remco Loos (cpl. 4th Dutch commando) for their epic struggle and hand-to-hand combat for first place in the fund-raising league table, and a '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentioned_in_Despatches">mention in despatches</a>' is presented to Nicolas Le Nov√©re (lt. 1st French prancers) for being the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_gun">Top Gun</a>' amongst the faculty. The platoon is now returning home, and will soon be changing back into '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civvies">civvies</a>' (much to the relief of their partners and family).<br />
<br />
If any other large science data centres want to make a fight of it for Movember 2012 - bring it on, we are waiting!<br />
