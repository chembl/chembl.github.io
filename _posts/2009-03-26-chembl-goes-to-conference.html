We are going to speak at the <A HREF="http://portal.acs.org:80/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=PP_TRANSITIONMAIN&node_id=2053&use_sec=false&sec_url_var=region1&__uuid=71b2619b-6a2a-418b-90ed-8b02248c2c38">238th ACS National Meeting, Washington, DC, August 16-20, 2009</A>, on "ChEMBL: Large-scale Mapping of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology Data to Genomes". The Abstract for the talk is:
<P>
Although the majority of effective therapeutics are small molecules,
there is relatively little readily accessible public domain data
mapping drugs to their molecular targets. When one considers clinical
trial stage, or discovery stage data, the situation deteriorates
further. However, this type of data is essential for Chemical Biology
experiments, and is crucial for informed target selection in drug
discovery. To address this issue, we have built a series of large
scale databases, known as ChEMBL, that map small molecule structures
to their target genes and also their functional effects. This data
also captures a large ammount of human and model organism
pharmacological data, systems often used in pre-clinical validation
and safety pharmacology testing. A variety of applications of these
databases in the area of target prioritisation, lead discovery, lead
optimisation and drug repurposing will be described.
