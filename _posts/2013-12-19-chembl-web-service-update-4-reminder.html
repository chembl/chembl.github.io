This post is to remind users of the ChEMBL Web Services that we will soon be changing the backend to use the new ChEMBL API. Since our initial announcement about the changes, which you can read about <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/chembl-web-service-update-1.html">here</a>, <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/chembl-web-service-update-2-jsonp-support.html">here</a> and <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/chembl-web-service-update-3-image.html">here</a>, we have made some more changes and optimisations, which speed up the services significantly.<br />
<br />
We thank everyone for feedback to date and urge anyone else who makes use of the ChEMBL Web Services to test the new version. Remember they are simple to test, just use the following temporary base URL and everything should work as if you are using the current live Web Services:<br />

<br />
We would like to make the change in January, so please get in touch if you have any questions or experience any problems.<br />
<br />
Once we have made the technology switch and happy that it is working in the wild as expected, we will be doing a complete review of the functionality offered by the current ChEMBL Web Services. So expected some big changes in 2014.<br />
