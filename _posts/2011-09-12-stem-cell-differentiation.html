Over the summer one of our interns has entered some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cells">stem-cell</a> differentiation into a small database - this is based on a literature search, followed by mapping the compounds to ChEMBL entries (or UniProt codes for protein factors). This was an Open Collaboration with Pfizer, who contributed the literature analysis, and also the mappings to the <a href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/39927">Cell Line Ontology</a>. It is pretty fascinating to be able to control the path of differentiation with things that could potentially, one day, be drugs.<br />
<br />
So, we could put this up as a microsite, have the data available for download, <i>etc</i>, if there is any interest?
