Just doing some year end things, before starting on the backlog over the weekend that has just magically accumulated somehow. I can feel so many New Year's resolutions coming on!<br />
<br />
Anyway, I came across a cool visualisation on Teh Internets of the growth/changes in an organisation, but the visualisation can probably be applied to a lot of areas where there is some hierarchical organisation - imagine a timeline of scaffold representation in the med. chem. literature compounds, or targets for drugs over time (including first and second generation agents, <i>etc</i>.), or patents, or .....<br />
<br />
Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkJ-Uy5dt5g&amp;feature=player_embedded">link to the YouTube video</a>.<br />

The original source is <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2012/12/18/animated-growth-of-an-organization/">here</a>, from the great, and new to me, <a href="http://flowingdata.com/">Flowing Data</a> site.<br />
