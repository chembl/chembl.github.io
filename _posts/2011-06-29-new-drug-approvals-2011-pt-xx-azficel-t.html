<div style="text-align: justify;">On June 21st 2011, the FDA approved azficel-T (trade name:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trademarkia.com/laviv-77794257.html">laViv</a>) for the aesthetic treatment of moderate to severe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolabial_fold">nasolabial fold wrinkles</a> in adults ("smile lines"). laViv is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autologous">autologous</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy">cell therapeutic</a>, consisting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblasts">fibroblasts</a> (cells which can produce&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen">collagen</a>) which are produced from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy">biopsy</a> of post-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear">auricular</a> tissue by proliferation <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span>, and re-injected into the nasolabial folds to improve their cosmetic appearance.  With increasing age, nasolabial folds can become more pronounced, caused by habitual facial expressions (<i>i.e.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese">laughing</a>), and a decline of collagen production.<br />
<br />
Alternative non-drug treatments include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposuction">liposuction</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facelift">facelift</a>.  After biopsy, dermal fibroblasts are expanded using standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_culture">tissue-culture</a> procedures until a sufficient amount of cells for re-injection is obtained. This process takes 11-22 weeks. laViv is provided in two vials of approximately 18 million fibroblasts in 1.2 mL suspension and should be administered in three sessions at 3-6 weeks intervals by injection at 0.1 mL per linear centimeter of nasolabial fold wrinkle. The mechanism by which laViv works is <a href="http://mylaviv.com/pdf/LAVIV-prescribing-info.pdf">not known</a>.<br />
<br />
In two clinical trials, the efficacy of azficel-T has been evaluated based on a five-point Subject Wrinkle Assessment scale, and additionally by physicians employing a six-point Evaulator Wrinkle Severity Assessment, and considered successful if a two-point improvement post- compared to pre-treatment was achieved. In both studies, the Subject Wrinkle Assessment for the group using laViv (57%/45%) was significantly improved as compared to the vehicle control group (30%/18%); equally, the Physician Wrinkle Assessment indicated an improvement of the condition using laViv (33%/19% as compared to 7% for both control groups).  To avoid immune reactions, the identity of donor and recipient has to be assured.<br />
<br />
Common adverse reations are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_site_reaction">injection-site reactions</a> such as redness, bruising, swelling, and pain. Pediatric safety and efficacy have not been established; clinical studies lack sufficient number of subjects in geriatric or non-White population. Efficacy of the product beyond six months has not been established.  laViv has been developed by <a href="http://www.fibrocellscience.com/">Fibrocell Technologies</a>.<br />
