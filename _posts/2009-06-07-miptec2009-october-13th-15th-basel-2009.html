We are going to speak at the forthcoming MipTec meeting in Basel - this is a free registration meeting, so it is pretty unusual (and good!). We will speak on bioisostere discovery from our chEMBL databases - probably in the area of peptide drugs and peptide bioisosteres.

As you may have noticed, today is a catch up with things-to-do-day, and also we are celebrating some of the kings (and maybe later, queens) of british comedy in the the blog pictures.
