<span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/timbal" target="_blank">TIMBAL</a> is a database containing small molecules that modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs). It was first created in 2008, by manually curating information extracted from relevant scientific publications. An analysis of the data was published in 2009,&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00889.x" target="_blank">(Higueruelo et al, 2009)</a>. The growth of data in the past years makes hand-curated databases a phenomenally time-consuming task. The maintenance of TIMBAL is done now through automated searches on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/" target="_blank">ChEMBL database</a>&nbsp;(currently using ChEMBL_14). The list of known PPI targets (<a href="http://mordred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/timbal/thanks">thank you!</a>) and its orthologs has been translated into&nbsp;<a href="http://mordred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/timbal/TIMBAL_uniprots.csv">UniProt codes</a>. These codes are then used in ChEMBL for searching small molecule data related to these proteins in binding assays with confidence that the assay is directly assigned to a single protein or its homolog. Currently the database has 4,681 data points from more than three thousand small molecules across 27 targets. The database also refers to 600 PDB entries related to these targets.</span><br />
