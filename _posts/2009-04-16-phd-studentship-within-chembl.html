The Chemogenomics (ChEMBL) group at the <A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk">European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)</A> in Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom, has an opening for a PhD position. The EMBL-EBI is one of four outstations of the <A HREF="http://www.embl.de">European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)</A> and is a great place to do research in biology, chemistry, and the interface with drug discovery. The EMBL is a unique environment for such interdisciplinary research, in a highly multi-cultural and international setting.
<P>
The ChEMBL group does research in target discovery and selection, lead discovery and optimisation and explores the role of genomics techniques in drug discovery, as such studies will involve large-scale data analysis, computing and programming, machine learning, protein structure and modelling, and broad coverage of drug discovery strategies. The successful candidate is free to choose from a range of topics (see below) or suggest ideas for their own project.
<P>
Applications need to be submitted by <B>15 July 2009</B> through the <A HREF="http://www.embl.org/training/phdprogramme/">EMBL PhD programme</A> and ideally the candidate should clearly indicate that they have a preference to work with us here at the EMBL-EBI. We would also consider favorably applicants from non-traditional academic backgrounds (re-training, career-swtiching, <I>etc.</I>)
<P>
Here are a few suggestions for potential projects (click <A HREF="http://chembl.blogspot.com/2009/02/phd-student-projects-in-chembl.html">here</A> for some more details on some of these).
<OL>
<LI>Non-human Secreted Proteins as New Therapies.
<LI>Monoclonal Antibody Drug ‘Rescue’.
<LI>Automated Drug Design (‘Robot-Chemist’).
<LI>Drug Design Strategies for Robustness to Acquired Resistance.
<LI>Drug and Target Annotation of Novel Genomes.
</OL>
<P>
There is also studentships available within the <A HREF="http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/">excellent Steinbeck group</A> at the EMBL-EBI (and I greatly thank Christoph for prompting me to place this posting in the ChEMBL blog, and also apologise for my shameless lifting of his text ;) )
