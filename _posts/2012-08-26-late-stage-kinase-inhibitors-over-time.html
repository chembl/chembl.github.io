<br />
A bunch of new USANs have just been defined, including some for protein kinase inhibitors; so this prompted me to update the kinase data, and plot the number of USANs (which is a pretty good, unambiguous proxy of late stage clinical compounds) as a function of time. So far it looks like the rate of development is slowing a little for 2012 (but this can change of course, depending on what happens in the remainder of the year).<br />
<br />
An interesting statistic is that 20% of protein kinase inhibitors (including the mTors) to have a USAN assigned have been approved (and overall 5.4% of all current clinical stage kinase inhibitors). Of course, these are not steady state figures, and there are still compounds coming through, so these are approximate lower bounds - but the percentages are unlikely to drift much higher.<br />
<br />
Update: Oh, the axes! - vertical is cumulative number of USANs, horizontal is year (so 87 is 1987, and 12 is 2012).
