Congratulations to one of our collaborators, <a href="http://www.icr.ac.uk/research/team_leaders/Workman_Paul/index.shtml">Paul Workman</a>&nbsp;FMedSci of the <a href="http://www.icr.ac.uk/">Institute of Cancer Research</a> on being awarded the <a href="http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/EntrepreneuroftheYear/2012-Winner.asp">RSC Chemistry World Entrepreneuur of the Year award for 2012</a>. This award recognizes individuals that have made significant contributions to the commercialisation of science. Paul has of course got a fantastic record of significant scientific discovery in the area of molecularly targeted cancer research, but has consistently searched for ways of generating value and patient benefit from these by founding a number of companies to move these discoveries forward to potential therapies and products - spending time with Paul really makes clear the drive, belief and energy that's required to make a great scientific entrepreneur and innovator.<br />
<br />
Examples of his commercialisation of science include the founding of Piramed (acquired in a successful exit by <a href="http://www.roche.com/">Roche</a>) and <a href="http://www.chromatherapeutics.com/">Chroma Therapeutics</a>.<br />
<br />
So well done Paul! And for readers of the blog interested in hearing some of Paul's translational research, there's a great opportunity to do this at the <a href="http://www.embl.de/training/events/2012/CHB12-01/participants/index.html">EMBO Chemical Biology 2012 meeting</a>.
