We have re-established the web service (originally called 'Strudle') to analyse and characterise protein structures for 'drug-like' or 'druggable' binding sites. The server allows browsing of results for current <A href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/">PDB</A> entries, sequence similarity searches, and secure upload and processing of 'private' coordinate sets (which, as long as they are standard PDB format could be experimental, modelled, <I>etc.</I>)<br />
<br />
<br />
The interface will go through quite a few changes in the near future, and because of this, your feedback would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
