One of the great things about large meetings (I'm at the 50th meeting of <a href="http://www.icaac.org/">ICAAC</a> at the moment) are the publisher's stalls; the sort of specialist literature I like doesn't make conventional bookshops, and how bad is Amazon for recommendations for actually surprising and expanding your horizons and interests....<br />
<br />
Anyway, we all have a little special someone in our lives, and this book, Germ Stories, is just for them. A set of delightful poems and rhymes about bugs, of all sorts, written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kornberg">Arthur Kornberg</a>&nbsp;for his children. Education and entertainment for youngsters at it's best. High production values in the book - good quality binding, nice relief printed titling on the dust jacket, and delightful illustrations. A stylistic merging of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Seuss"> Dr. Seuss</a> with interesting subject matter, but in no sense is this nonsense. A must buy for all parents - especially at the show price of $20!<br />
