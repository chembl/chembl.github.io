Sometimes, when something great happens, you've just got to find out, or tell the world, straight away, just like those proud fellas in the picture above.<br />
<br />
So, would there be an interest in an RSS feed of selected ChEMBL content? The sort of thing that is probably useful would be to have alerts for new bioactivity for an already existing ChEMBL compound, or for an already existing ChEMBL target/assay.<br />
<br />
Any comments/mail gratefully received. If there is interest, we'll integrate this into our plans for next year.
