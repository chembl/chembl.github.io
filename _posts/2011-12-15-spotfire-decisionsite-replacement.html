We used to use Spotfire DecisionSite for data visualisation, and liked it a lot - we've just found out there are some pretty major changes to the licensing; and are now looking for alternatives if we can't work out a way forward. So, any suggestions for good data exploration tools, preferably with some sort of chemistry capabilities. Ideally they would run natively on Mac OsX.<br />

Ideas in the comments please.....
