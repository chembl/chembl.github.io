Chris Steinbeck and I are off to the eScience for Chemoinformatics and Drug Discovery Meeting on the 11th December in Bloomington Indiana. <a href="http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/eScience2008/">Link to conference website</a>. This should be fun, and I will try and fix up a few meetings around this. Too bad the pound is so weak against the dollar now. However, looking for 'shrooms is free, so I will try and take a days holiday while out there to try and find something interesting.
