Of potentially limited global interest due to the sole coverage of the <A HREF="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2625.aspx">London Underground Network</A> (known as 'The Tube'). However, for me, it's super useful. I'm forever getting on a tube-train, then having to fight against the flow to get to my connection or exit. Wouldn't it be nice to unlock the secrets of optimal carriage occupancy? This app is very simple, enter your start and finish stations (alongside any interchanges if you want) and it will tell you what carriage to enter for a speedy exit. The interface is nice and clean, and the display of the trains pulling into the platform hold the interest of children (and Strudel the dog). Cost is Â£1.79, and there is a free version which covers the 12 busiest stations. Further details are on the website - <A HREF="http://www.tubeexits.co.uk">www.tubeexits.co.uk</A>
