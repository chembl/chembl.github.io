It contains annotation on the entire human proteome, and contains &gt;8 million experimental data points including RNAi and chemical screening data. For full release notes please see <a href="https://cansar.icr.ac.uk/index2.php?redirect=news&amp;autologin=guest">canSAR news</a>. canSAR is updated monthly.  As well as the wonderful chEMBL, the data in canSAR comes from a large number of sources, including <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/">ArrayExpress</a>, <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/">PDBe</a>, <a href="http://rock.icr.ac.uk/">ROCK</a>, <a href="http://string-db.org/">STRING</a>, <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/translation/">Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer</a>, <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/">COSMIC</a>, <a href="http://www.bindingdb.org/">BindingDB</a>, <a href="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/">SCOP</a>, <a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/">PFAM</a>- we (at the ICR) are grateful to our friends at all these places for their help.  In the new year, we will be holding a series of webinars and walkthroughs, and details of these will be posted on the ChEMBL-og.
