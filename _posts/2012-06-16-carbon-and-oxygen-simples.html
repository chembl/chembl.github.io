Bissan and I just had a really good breakfast discussion on drugs, and it prompted me to do a picture for the blog. There'll be some more, depending on collecting glasses from the opticians, getting some ivermectin for the tick infections that have appeared on Vini and Bruce the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearded_dragons">bearded dragons</a> (named after two of the major protagonists of the fantastic and situationist&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Durutti_Column">durutti column</a>), the length of the queue of cars at the <a href="https://www.sutton.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=691">municipal tip in Sutton</a>, and other weekend domestic stuff.<br />
<br />
Carbon and Oxygen are two essential life elements, and really important in drug structures - in fact, most drugs are 'organic' chemicals - those based on primarily on carbon chemistry. Carbon and oxygen can be combined in chemical reactions in various ways to give a number of compounds - they are all oxides of carbon. These are...<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">Carbon dioxide</a> - CO<sub>2</sub> - that well known environmental villain (and also life sustaining chemical)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide">Carbon monoxide</a> - CO - that well known poison (and also endogenous signalling molecule)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_suboxide">Carbon suboxide</a> - C<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> - that not so well known oxide of carbon (this one has few virtues) This is one of my interview questions to probe people's chemistry knowledge (keep this important fact a secret though).</li>
</ul>
<br />
As an interesting aside these are all linear molecules.<br />
<br />
Imagine the atom ratios of these compounds plotted on a line, between a carbon ratio 1.0 (the element carbon, which occurs in a variety of expensive/worthless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes">allotropes</a>) and 0.0 (which would be the element oxygen - which physically, under normal conditions occurs as that life giving molecule dioxygen (which can also be poisonous), and ozone (again that life giving/taking molecule)).&nbsp;So for the carbon oxides, CO is at coordinate 0.5, CO<sub>2</sub> at 0.333, <i>etc</i>. This is what it looks like.....<br />

<u>Update</u> - here's the same but for combinations of oxygen and nitrogen.<br />

Of course, things become more interesting when you mix in more elements...... What I am discovering though is that triangular graphs are more complicated than I remember from when I was 12 years old.
