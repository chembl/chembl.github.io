<br />
There are a comparatively large number of Chinese company invented drug entering clinical trials now - these are typically assigned USAN/INN looky-likey names, and seem to obey stem naming conventions. Does anyone know how these are assigned, is there an equivalent of USAN in China, where does the data get published, <i>etc</i>.?<br />
<br />
As specific examples of these, there are a set of kinase inhibitors - Epitinib (EGFR), Flumatinib (ABL1), Fruquintinib (VEGFR), Icotinib (EGFR), Sulfatinib (VEGFR FGFR), Volitnib (MET).<br />
<br />
I've also asked this question on Quora - I'll post any replies there in the comments section here.<br />
<br />
<u>Update: To be clear, I have no interest in the commercial import/export of drug substances into or out of China, I'm only interested in the name assignment process.</u>
