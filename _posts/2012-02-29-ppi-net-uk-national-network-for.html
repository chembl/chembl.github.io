Yesterday I took part in a workshop on targeted libraries at the Univeristy of Leeds - it was a great meeting, with lots of good ideas on directing compound design towards this class of interaction (Protein-Protein Interactions, PPIs - now form a significant fraction of the interesting target systems for drug discovery and basic biology and the development of tool compounds/leads that modulate these is a major challenge due to the low ligand efficiency characteristics of the majority of PPI binding sites).<br />
<br />
There is a great <a href="http://ppi-net.org/">website</a>, with a collection of key references, contacts, <i>etc</i>.<br />
<br />
I came away determined to do a couple of things:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Resurrect some old F77 code (yay!) to look at peptide binding pharmacophores.</li>
<li>Try and play a bit with Facebook/LinkedIn as a sort of dating site for unattached chemical/biologists.</li>
</ol>
