<P>
I was mailed about how USANs/INNs fit into the drug development process. There is an excellent and detailed overview on the <A HREF="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/coalitions-consortiums/united-states-adopted-names-council/drug-name-development-timeline-usan-review.shtml">AMA website</A>, and I've taken the liberty of reproducing some of the most salient points here (however, the preceeding link and the content therein is the definitive source!). The other terms you'll often see in this sort of area are JAN and BAN (which are Japanese Approved Name and British Approved Name respectively), BANs with the exception of adrenaline/epinephrine are the same as INNs now.
