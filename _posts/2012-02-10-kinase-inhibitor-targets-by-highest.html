With a little bit of data wrangling I was able to convert the kinase clinical data we have to a form which shows the highest phase achieved for a particular target class - major distinct known activities were clustered together, and not surprisingly, the largest class was then classified as "multi" - i.e. significant known activity across multiple distinct branches of the kinome tree.<br />
<br />
A little bit of explanation of the graph, blue = phase 1, green = phase 2, yellow = phase 3 and blue = launched. Targets are the x-axis, and the number of compounds that have reached that clinical phase are on the y-axis.<br />
<br />
The graph is crappy - I couldn't get Numbers to behave - sorry, but <i>c'est la vie</i>. (Click image for larger)<br />

If you want the data yourself in spreadsheet form mail me.
