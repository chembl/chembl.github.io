Some time ago I posted, in an idle moment, the C<a href="http://chembl.blogspot.com/2010/04/is-h-value-useful-measure-of-blogs.html">hEMBL-og International H-value</a>. The corresponding number now is 51 (of 143 distinct countries in total), so if you know any United Arab Emirate, Bangladesh, or Vietnam scientists (the countries who could realistically make a difference to this number) who would be interested in the sort of stuff we get up to, let them know!<br />
<br />
<u>Update</u>. Looking at two analytics measures for the ChEMBL-og, both from <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>. Google Analytics is consistently 30-35% down on the pageview count from the Blogger Analytics data - I guess the Blogger which is server side and doesn't require the js scripts of Google Analytics (and therefore is easy to suppress/block etc). I'd be interested in hearing other blog authors thoughts/experience.
