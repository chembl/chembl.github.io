Came across a link on Google+ to a post to a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/02/10/the-truly-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs/">Forbes article</a> (<i>via</i> Greg Landrum) and thought I would post a link here. It's a simple economic analysis of the costs of Large Pharma drug discovery. Very simple, money in <i>vs</i>. drugs out. There is however a lot of complexity behind the numbers, for example - quite a few of the drugs will have been licensed in, the transaction costs for these in-licensing events have probably been factored in, but what about all the other burnt capital in the biotech companies that supplied the in-licensed compounds - this will inflate the numbers further. Of course the majority of these costs are incurred on the failed projects, the wrong targets, the wrong compounds, or the wrong trials.<br />
<br />
To put the AstraZeneca number of $11.8 billion per drug in some national context (equivalent to £7.5 billion) - this is almost 17 years of the entire BBRSC budget (£445 million in 2011), or only two drugs from the entire investment portfolio of the mighty assets of the Wellcome Trust (~£14 billion in 2011) - that's right, not two drugs from their annual research budget, but two drugs by shutting down the investment fund and putting it all into drug discovery and development (at Astra Zeneca ROI levels).<br />
<br />
Scary numbers, eh?<br />
<br />
Are public funding agencies up to the task? Do we really know what to do differently?<br />

There's also a <a href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2012/02/10/the_terrifying_cost_of_a_new_drug.php">post</a> on the same Forbes article on the In The Pipeline blog.
