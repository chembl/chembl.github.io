A few months ago, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Crystals-Life-Personal-Celerino-Abad-Zapatero/dp/0972077405/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1285135001&amp;sr=8-1">Cele Abad-Zapatero</a> visited our lab here at the EMBL-EBI, he touched all our lives in many ways and was a pleasure to have around. The sort of lab visitor anyone would welcome! Anyway, while here, we worked together on Cele's long-standing idea of an 'atlas' representation of target-chemical space, and a variety of descriptors will be incorporated into the ChEMBL database over the next few releases, both for visualisation, and also to enable data mining.<br />
