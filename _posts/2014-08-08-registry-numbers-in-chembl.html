The numbers are in - the public vote (N=69, so quite small) was overwhelmingly (in roughly a 3:1 ratio) in favour of including registry numbers in ChEMBL/UniChem, as you will see from the screenshot above. There was some discussion (see Google+ and ChEMBL-og comments for details, as well as some Twitter response (it's pretty easy to hunt down if you are really really interested). So we will see what we can do.....
