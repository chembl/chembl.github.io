<br />
ChEMBL_15 will be released this week. As mentioned previously, there will be some major schema changes. For many users, the most significant of these will be:<br />
<br />
1) Removal of protein-specific information (e.g., sequences/accessions) from the target_dictionary to a separate 'component_sequences' table. The target_dictionary now includes entries for protein complexes, protein families and other 'group' targets. These then link to their protein components via the target_components table.<br />
<br />
2) Removal of the assay2target table. Each assay now links only to a single target (though this target may consist of multiple proteins in the case of a protein complex/family). Information previously included on the assay2target table (tid, confidence_score etc) is now on the assays table.<br />
<br />
We have provided a diagram and documentation of the new schema on the chembl ftp site:<br />
<a href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/releases/chembl_15/">ChEMBL_15 release documentation</a><br />
<br />
Please take some time to familiarise yourselves with the changes before integrating the new dataset.&nbsp;Further information will be provided in the release notes, and we will be running a webinar in the next few weeks to explain the changes.<br />
