It's been snowing, and I'm just here on an overnight stopover - but it is a really nice place, looks very pretty, clean efficient and friendly. Haven't been here for about 20 years, but it hasn't changed. As the picture above shows, it has a Bauhaus inspired design, and there's quite a lot of period posters and explanation of the style around the building, but the rooms (at least the one I had) have a more conventional decor. And it is close to the EMBL Heidelberg campus. As expected due to its location, there are special links to EMBL itself. 
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.isg-hotel.de">hotel website</A> (German and English) makes clear the special benefits. This is the <B>best 'visiting scientist hotel'</B> so far with a stonking 66% score. And a visit in September/October with little wrinkles sorted out on internet access, it could be even higher.

<LI>Getting There - 4/10 Why, Oh Why, is there not a Heidelberg airport ? - about 45 minutes to get here from Karlsruhe. So make sure you have some cash for a cab (60Euro will be sufficient).
<LI>Cost - 8/10 ca. Euro70 a night including breakfast, with a discount for EMBL staff. Now if only the pound wasn't so weak against the Euro.
<LI>Internet - 8/10 Free! (to EMBL staff anyway) fast and didn't find any port oddities. This would have been a 10 but the first  password I had had expired, and there were a few problems with my DNS that meant I couldn't get to certain domains - no real pattern to these, but the essentials all worked.
<LI>Conference facilities - 7/10 - Looks very good indeed.
<LI>Mushroom factor - 6/10 Snow on the ground, but looks really promising. All I need to do is to get a meeting here in September.
