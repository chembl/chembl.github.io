Anyway, a book, if the preface is not a call to arms, I don't know what is, this really is an essential book for every scientist (who lives in or visits the British Isles). It is also a book that when I reach for it from the shelves, the kids run to tidy up, or state they have homework. regardless, I will quote from the first couple of sentences from the preface....

The Population of the British Isles is less than 0.2% that of the entire earth (<I>sic</I>); yet this tiny fraction of human society is responsible for an enormous number of cultural advances in both the arts and sciences.
